This is a [Press Record](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/pressrecord.html) project file. Jentery Sayers created it on 10 November 2025 and last updated it on 13 December 2025 with feedback from Praxis Studio researchers. It is a draft and thus subject to change. We will version it 1.0 once it is ready for circulation. **Please do not cite this document** in the meantime.  

# Gameplay Footage Collection 
This document contains the metadata terms and controlled vocabularies for the Praxis Studio's Gameplay Footage Collection. The Collection is intended for teaching, learning, and research in Media Studies at UVic. It contains short clips (30 seconds to five minutes long) of gameplay stored in Echo360. We limit the number of clips per game to five, and we do not include clips that are NSFW or spoil a game's ending(s). Most clips contain footage from the first three hours of a game. 

For search purposes, the metadata for each clip appears in its Echo360 title, and all of the Collection's metadata is stored in a spreadsheet we update regularly. 

Project leads at UVic: Jentery Sayers and Charlie Susheski (with feedback from Callum Carroll-Ireton, Abby Fry, Maya Wei Yan Linsley, Hector Lopez, Emma Newton, Marie Silhova, and Christina Woods)

"'[I]n 80 Days Passepartout['s] perceived whiteness and masculinity and Frenchness never go unremarked. We don't treat these as though they are "normal," or automatically powerful. We mark bits of the map as off limits because of them, we have NPCs deny you authority and question your motives because of it. Whiteness and masculinity make you an outsider in 80 Days more often than it allows you within the circle. We remind players of Passepartout's social and cultural limitations. NPCs will often discuss their plans, goals, and ideas with Passepartout — but we very rarely allow Passepartout to make a choice for them.'  — [Meghna Jayanth](https://medium.com/@betterthemask/forget-protagonists-writing-npcs-with-agency-for-80-days-and-beyond-703201a2309) (writer for the game) in 2016" is an example of data intended for this field.

This is a text input field without a controlled vocabulary. The filename is intended for internal reference and project maintenance. "80DaysAmphitriteExpressToParis.MP4" is an example of data intended for this field. Using Camel casing, the filename should include the title of the game followed by the title of the clip.

This data does not appear in the clip's Echo360 title or description field. It appears only in the spreadsheet.
