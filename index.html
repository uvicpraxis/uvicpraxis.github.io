<p>We <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/services/indigenous/facultystaff/territory-acknowledgment/index.php">acknowledge</a> and respect the Lək̓ʷəŋən (Songhees and Xʷsepsəm/Esquimalt) Peoples on whose territory the university stands, and the Lək̓ʷəŋən and W̱SÁNEĆ Peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.</p>

    <h1 class="c-article__title" id="what">What We Do</h1>
  </header>
<p>We identify pressing topics in media studies, articulate them as Studio themes, research and write about them, and hold events to engage them. Our current themes are:
<ul> 
<li><b>Player Stories</b>: examining how people document and narrate their experiences with games</li>
<li><b>Videographic Criticism</b>: pushing the boundaries of the video essay as a scholarly format</li>
<!--li><b>Uncanning Sounds</b>: stewarding creative audio from the past into the present</li-->
<li><b>Media Literacy and Pedagogy</b>: fostering the "people skills" of critical media practice</li>
</ul>
