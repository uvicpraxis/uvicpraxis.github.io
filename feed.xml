        <title>Currently (2022-23)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m on sabbatical until July 1st to complete a monograph on the sounds of playable fiction. I am also writing an open access textbook for undergraduate students with interests in media studies and fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sabbatical, I’m scheduled to teach four English courses at UVic: “Contemporary Media and Fiction” (ENGL 230) and “Player Stories: On Games and Interactive Fiction” (ENGL 506) in Fall 2022 and then “Cultural Studies” (ENGL 466) and “Games and Interactive Fiction: Special Studies in a Genre” (ENGL 391) in Spring 2023. “Player Stories” will be a graduate seminar, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/assets/docs/Course%20Descriptions/2022-23description-expanded.pdf&quot;&gt;description of it&lt;/a&gt; is now online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you’re keeping as well as can be right now. Thanks for stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Comics + America</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Comics and Contemporary America” (Spring 2021) was an upper-level, online English course intended for 40 students. I assumed those students had no previous experience reading or studying comics at university, so I covered some foundations to get us started: terms, techniques, and histories that would help us to better grasp the assigned materials. Then we focused on comics published in the 21st century and how they comment on, or correspond with, contemporary American culture. Those comics included &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, Vol. 1: &lt;em&gt;No Normal&lt;/em&gt; (2014), Victor LaValle’s &lt;em&gt;Destroyer&lt;/em&gt; (2017), &lt;em&gt;Monstress&lt;/em&gt;, Vol. 1: &lt;em&gt;Awakening&lt;/em&gt; (2016), &lt;em&gt;Special Exits&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and &lt;em&gt;Daytripper&lt;/em&gt; (2010; published by DC Comics but written and illustrated by Brazilian artists, Fábio Moon and Gabriel Bá).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course was my first attempt at teaching comics for an entire term rather than including a graphic novel or two on an American fiction or media studies syllabus. I revised my approach to assignments accordingly, situating each prompt in a hypothetical scenario grounded in concrete details. Here are two examples: 1) “The Canadian Society for the Study of Comics invites papers on comics in the post-secondary classroom. They are looking for focused arguments (750-1000 words), informed by classroom experiences, for particular comics that should be taught and studied in the 2020s. These papers will be collected and published on the Society’s website. There may also be a conference panel on the topic. Intrigued, you decide to submit a paper.” 2) “Imagine you occasionally produce audio and video content for an online Canadian publication about comics and comics culture. It’s June 2017, and one of the venue’s editors has asked you to review &lt;em&gt;Awakening&lt;/em&gt;, the first volume of &lt;em&gt;Monstress&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a relatively short review. They’ve given you no more than five minutes. They are also a bit behind on this one. &lt;em&gt;Awakening&lt;/em&gt; was published in July 2016, and it collects issues 1-6 of &lt;em&gt;Monstress&lt;/em&gt;, which was first published in late 2015. But you take the gig.” My interest in roleplaying games is not mildly apparent in these instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students could choose one of two prompts for each assignment, but both paths nudged them to consider how fiction and criticism are mediated by various factors, from context and intended audience to genre and style to cultural values and the complex dynamics between image and text. One thing that struck me was how compelling and insightful student responses can be when the particular conditions of the writing situation, even if speculative, are communicated to them. This realization probably isn’t news to writing experts, yet “Comics and Contemporary America” rendered it palpable to me nearly ten years after arriving at UVic. The hypothetical scenarios aided the class, too, as they offered us shared spaces to picture and inhabit while we met online during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official description of the course is below, together with links to the course website and syllabus. Many thanks to Faith Ryan for teaching this course with me, and to Molly Butler and Fiona Thompson for giving me permission to include images of their work here. The image above is a panel Molly made as an exercise in imitating the style of another comic: in this case, the style of Alison Bechdel’s &lt;em&gt;Fun Home&lt;/em&gt;. The image below captures one of many ways Fiona annotated &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;; as part of a hypothetical scenario, Fiona’s annotations were intended to engage high school students in how comics create superhuman characters and express superhuman powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics and Contemporary America&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
Spring 2021 | UVic English 425 | Undergraduate course for 40 students&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/425/&quot;&gt;course website&lt;/a&gt; (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/425/425Spring2021syllabus.pdf&quot;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt; (PDF); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/425/index.html#prompts&quot;&gt;prompts&lt;/a&gt; (HTML)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comics are integral to the study of America and American fiction today. They experiment with representation, play with genre, speak truth to power, and prompt important conversations about art and culture. We’ll discuss these topics and more by engaging the politics and aesthetics of 21st-century comics and sampling various critical approaches to them. You’ll learn how comics work, why they matter, and how to write about them for popular and academic audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aims&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
You’ll have the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Demonstrate various strategies for approaching comics. You’ll develop a vocabulary for talking about them, too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interpret comics in the context of fiction and contemporary America (2000 to the present) while attending to some histories of comics and their genres.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify techniques people use to makes comics and explain why the aesthetics of comics matter today.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Articulate the relationship between comics and power, including the subversive and normative elements of comics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate critically &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; comics and &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; them. This means you’ll treat comics as not only evidence or examples (communicating &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; comics) but also ways of experiencing and understanding the world (communicating &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; comics).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will assume you’ve no previous experience studying comics in an academic setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Us&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him / his; jentery@uvic.ca). I’m a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT) at UVic. I also direct the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uvicpraxis.github.io/&quot;&gt;Praxis Studio&lt;/a&gt; for Comparative Media Studies. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington in Seattle, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I got my BA and BS at Virginia Commonwealth University. I’ve been at UVic since 2011, and I teach courses on American fiction, media and cultural studies, and experimental prototyping. This is the 35th class I’ve taught here, but only my third online. I’ll be learning a bit as we go. Thanks for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my name is Faith Ryan (she / her / hers). I’m a settler on unceded Lekwungen and &lt;u&gt;W&lt;/u&gt;SÁNEĆ lands, and I am grateful for the years I’ve been able to study here. I’m a graduate student in English at UVic, and I did my BA at UVic as well. I’m originally from Ogden, Utah, but I spent most of my high school years in the lower mainland BC. I like contemporary Canadian and American fiction and approaching culture, in all its forms, from a disability studies perspective. Feel free to reach out over the term, even if you’re unsure whether it’s something I can assist you with. If it isn’t, then I can point you in the right direction. I hope you enjoy the course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignments&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
We are asking you to respond to &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/425/index.html#prompts&quot;&gt;four prompts&lt;/a&gt; this term, and we’ll invite you to revise one of those responses. Each response will constitute 25% of your final grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no quizzes, exams, discussion forums, or student presentations in this course. There is no participation mark, either. Both of us will mark your responses to the prompts and provide feedback on your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/425/index.html#prompts&quot;&gt;prompts&lt;/a&gt; are included in this outline, and due dates are provided in the schedule. Please submit each of your responses via Brightspace. We cannot accept submissions by email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that each prompt affords two ways to respond to it, and not all responses are academic essays. You should pick &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the two options in the prompt and then consider your audience as well as the assignment’s aims (mentioned in the prompt) as you respond. We’ll use the aims as guides to mark your responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workload&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;
One of the most important things to know about this course is that &lt;em&gt;we’ll opt for care in every instance.&lt;/em&gt; If the workload becomes too much, or we’re juggling more than we should, then we’ll cut materials, including assignments, as we go. We’ve planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won’t get to everything. And that’s totally fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We suggest dedicating an average of 3 to 5 hours of study each week to this course, plus 1.5 hours for the weekly meetings. To frame expectations and decrease overwork, we assign in the schedule a number of recommended hours to each week of the course, and we communicate progress in terms of weekly steps (0-14) toward completing the course, partly because online learning makes time weird for us all, and focusing on anything is a struggle during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need (or want) more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, what you can manage during a given week of life and online learning, and your own familiarity with the comics and concepts involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Here’s a list of the comics we’ll read this term. They’re available at the UVic Bookstore. You are also welcome to read them as ebooks on a tablet or in your browser, if you’d prefer. You should spend no more than $117 (before taxes) on these books. Purchasing used copies or ebooks, or relying on subscription services, will save you money. (Ebooks may total as little as $47 for this course, saving you up to $70 before taxes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, Vol. 1: &lt;em&gt;No Normal&lt;/em&gt; (2014), by G. Willow Wilson, Adrian Alphona, and Jake Wyatt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Victor LaValle’s &lt;em&gt;Destroyer&lt;/em&gt; (2017), by Victor LaValle and Dietrich Smith&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monstress&lt;/em&gt;, Vol. 1: &lt;em&gt;Awakening&lt;/em&gt; (2016), by Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daytripper&lt;/em&gt; (2010), by Fábio Moon and Gabriel Bá&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special Exits&lt;/em&gt; (2010), by Joyce Farmer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to pick up Hillary Chute’s &lt;em&gt;Why Comics? From Underground to Everywhere&lt;/em&gt; (2017) and/or Scott McCloud’s &lt;em&gt;Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art&lt;/em&gt; (1993), too. We’ll refer to both throughout the term, but having your own copies won’t be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also share examples of work by some (or perhaps all) of the following people during our meetings: Weshoyot Alvitre, Rosaire Appel, Kyle Baker, Lynda Barry, Alison Bechdel, Joyce Brabner, Charles Burns, Emily Carroll, Ezra Claytan Daniels, Eleanor Davis, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Will Eisner, Sigrid Ellis, Emil Ferris, Matt Fraction, Neil Gaiman, Dave Gibbons, Kieron Gillen, Phoebe Gloeckner, Roberta Gregory, Joy Harjo, the Hernandez brothers, John Jennings, Stephen Graham Jones, Tom King, Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, Jeff Lemire, Sloane Leong, Erik Loyer, David Mazzuchelli, Scott McCloud, Jamie McKelvie, Carla Speed McNeil, Mike Mignola, Alan Moore, Robert Morales, Brennan Lee Mulligan, Molly Ostertag, Harvey Pekar, Ed Piskor, Greg Rucka, Gail Simone, Nick Sousanis, Art Spiegelman, Frank Stack, Fiona Staples, Brian K. Vaughan, Tillie Walden, Chris Ware, Bill Watterson, Delicia Williams, and Gene Luen Yang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, near the end of the term, we’ll read Raymond Williams’s “The Analysis of Culture” (1961), available via Brightspace in PDF; in March, we’ll watch Erik Loyer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmJb3a2nOao&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&quot;&gt;“Timeframing: Temporal Aesthetics in Digital Comics”&lt;/a&gt; (2020); and, in February, we hope to screen, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/ondemand/whitescriptsblacksuperme&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;White Scripts and Black Supermen: Black Masculinities in Comic Books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2010), which was produced, written, and directed by Jonathan Gayles. In early February, we will draw lecture material from Stuart Hall’s “Notes on Deconstructing ‘The Popular’” (1981) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/JulianChambliss/videos&quot;&gt;Dr. Julian Chambliss’s work&lt;/a&gt; on comics and the comic book industry. We will make a PDF of Hall’s essay available to you, and Dr. Chambliss’s videos are already available on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, see the &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/425&quot;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt; for the course.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Pedagogy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities&lt;/em&gt; is an open access book written in the “keywords” tradition of Raymond Williams’s seminal publication, but it also collects, describes, and ultimately foregrounds the “stuff” of pedagogy–syllabi, prompts, guides, projects, student work, and even primary sources–for instructors to reuse and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;82 authors contributed 59 keyword chapters, each containing a curatorial statement and ten pedagogical resources, which were categorized, tagged, attributed, and annotated with commentary, representative screen caps, permissions, lists of related materials, and links to the originals where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D. Harris, and I started this project with the Modern Language Association back in 2012, after Kathy and I had drafted a book proposal for a companion to digital pedagogy. The four of us served as general editors, and in July 2014 we began sharing our editorial process via GitHub. I contributed to the project until early 2018, when Rebecca, Matt, and Kathy kindly agreed to see it to completion. The MLA published &lt;em&gt;Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities&lt;/em&gt; online in 2020, having dedicated an incredible amount of time, resources, and staff talent to building it in Humanities Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot about pedagogy while designing, developing, editing, and reading &lt;em&gt;Digital Pedagogy&lt;/em&gt;. I also learned a lot about myself. For instance, I was initially tempted to do all the things. &lt;em&gt;What if we added X, or readers could do Y?&lt;/em&gt; I gather this temptation is common among web-based projects, “unbounded” such as they may be, and thus I spent nearly a decade educating myself about scope and feature creep. I realized as well how important design is to me and my own editorial process. Between 2012 and 2020, our team presented multiple states of the book across an array of formats and platforms: Word, Markdown, GitHub, CommentPress, MLA Commons, Humanities Commons . . . Interestingly enough, many of these versions remain discoverable online, providing audiences with a “change history” of sorts. &lt;em&gt;How did the book morph over a few years? How did this become that?&lt;/em&gt; I find such change and experimentation to be quite fascinating; however, I should balance them with respect for the time and labor of an entire team: in this case, fellow editors, the MLA, and our 80+ contributing authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know more about not only prototyping a large project and routinely testing its scholarly apparatus but also communicating clearly, and early, about what’s feasible, what’s expected, and when. Doing so helps me to avoid those embarrassing follow-up emails to people who are already busy enough. &lt;em&gt;Sorry, but would you be willing to also provide Z for your chapter? Could you scrap A and try B instead?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learn from speaking candidly with collaborators, too, and that’s incredibly tricky in a large project. What do we value in the academy? In our communities? How will this project affect our other personal and professional commitments? Whom might the project risk marginalizing or objectifying? Whom will it benefit most? How precarious are our employment situations? How much can each of us commit to this publication, and by when do each of us expect it (or need it) to be published? Who isn’t at the table, how will we acquire permissions, and whose consent is essential before we proceed? Where will the final project be housed, and how we will maintain it? Have we consulted with, or included, librarians? When might the project require additional collaborators, and how will we invite and acknowledge them? How will we approach credit and attribution, generally speaking? How might we build flexibility into our plans and work cultures? Do we care to use task management software? How does meeting frequently across time zones sound to everyone, and when might such a commitment increase individual and/or collective anxiety?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I consider questions such as these before a project begins &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; as it unfolds, then I’m far less likely to juggle too much, tacitly endorse overwork, and eventually disappoint myself and others. I also become better aware of when my various projects might overlap too significantly, result in scheduling difficulties, generate conflicts of interest, and overwhelm me. After all, large, open access projects are tough to plan and maintain, and they demand a lot from us. Just because it’s online doesn’t mean it was fast or easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are links to multiple versions, including the final version, of &lt;em&gt;Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities&lt;/em&gt;, together with an official description of the collection, its table of contents, author names, and links to all 59 chapters and the introduction. I also point to Nicky Agate’s April 2015 interview with the editorial team, the Markdown template we initially used for book chapters, and a digital pedagogy course I taught with Diane Jakacki and Kathy Harris at UVic in June 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my coeditors, Rebecca, Kathy, and Matt; to all our amazing authors (listed below); to Diane for teaching “Digital Pedagogy” with Kathy and me; to everyone at the MLA (past and present), including Nicky Agate, Anne Donlon, Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Angela Gibson, Laura Kiernan, Katherine Kim, Eric Knappe, Tom Lewek, Margit Longbrake, Sara Pastel, Jonathan Reeve, and Chris Zarate; and to the members of our project’s advisory board: Cheryl Ball, Bryan Carter, Tanya Clement, Brian Croxall, Douglas Eyman, Paul Fyfe, Gail Hawisher, Jason B. Jones, Virginia Kuhn, Cynthia Selfe, and Lisa Spiro.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Readers Are Listening</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed this graduate seminar (Fall 2020) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as a course about ways of not only listening to fiction and literary audio but also writing about literature and culture for a listening audience. I then adapted it for the zoomroom where we met each week. Early on, I emphasized the potential benefits or appeals of inhabiting a private acoustic sphere while social distancing. When might people want or need to listen alone during a pandemic? Why might they want or need to multitask, listening to one thing while also doing something else? And how might people listen together as a group online, in an attention economy and environment oriented toward screens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing from approaches to my previous seminar, &lt;a href=&quot;/aesthetics&quot;&gt;“Media Aesthetics”&lt;/a&gt;, I opted for a range of formats. We listened to audiobooks, radio plays, recorded readings, sound art, podcasts, voice-over, and games, and we shifted between modes of interpretation as we went. Student interest gravitated over time toward vocality studies and its intersections with literary and media studies, and research by scholars such as Nina Sun Eidsheim, Mara Mills, Dylan Robinson, and Jonathan Sterne became central to our discussions. We began the seminar by listening to Toni Morrison read &lt;em&gt;The Bluest Eye&lt;/em&gt; (1970), which set the tone for engaging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audio as both a format and medium (the audiobook).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The political phenomenology of listening, speaking, reading, and seeing as value-laden forms of learning and discipline (the primacy of visible language and whiteness in the “look-say” paradigm of Dick and Jane readers in &lt;em&gt;The Bluest Eye&lt;/em&gt; as well as popular assumptions today about how listening to books is “passive”).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organized sound as song but also listening for what goes unsaid and how it is said (the blues, laughter, repetition, rhythm, silence, and “truth in timbre” in &lt;em&gt;The Bluest Eye&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing and visual media as evoked sound (“our icebox door opening on rusty hinges in July” in &lt;em&gt;The Bluest Eye&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vocality as polyvocality (Morrison the author, narrator, reader, and character voice tending to refuse dramatization).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2020-21 was the first time I’d taught online, I tried to keep things simple by focusing the seminar’s trajectory on a single project: the production of a podcast episode about any topic we addressed in the course. I then structured the seminar as a series of steps (see image below) toward that project and created an online space for everyone to share their audio in progress. That space morphed organically into something like a dial-a-poem network but for literary and cultural criticism. It wasn’t exactly public or open. It was intended instead for a small group of people with shared investments contributing to an ongoing conversation about the politics and aesthetics of listening, broadly understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to the course website and syllabus for “Readers Are Listening” are below, followed by a seminar description and list of assigned materials (written in the first and second person for a student audience). I also point to a 2020 SpokenWeb talk I gave on the topic of Delia Derbyshire’s compositions and to the &lt;em&gt;BC Studies&lt;/em&gt; podcast, where Isabelle Ava-Pointon at UBC interviewed me about audio practice, pedagogy, and “Readers Are Listening.” Many thanks to everyone who participated in the seminar for their exceptional work and for building a caring and thoughtful community in such difficult circumstances. Thanks as well to guest speaker, Julie Funk, who facilitated a seminar workshop on “literary machine listening.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Seminar&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
“Readers are listening.” We’ll treat that sentence, including its many implications, as a refrain for this seminar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers are listening because, as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booknetcanada.ca/readers-are-listening&quot;&gt;2018 BookNet Canada report&lt;/a&gt; suggests, more and more of them are purchasing audiobooks and subscribing to podcasts. Readers are listening because publishers, writers, actors, and critics are taking sound more seriously. Readers are listening because they’ve been diagnosed with print disabilities or visual impairments. They are listening because they are multitasking—listening while commuting, working at home, or engaging in hobbies. Readers are listening because they enjoy it, they need a break from screens, or they’re playing games. The list goes on, all to demonstrate that the combination of reading and listening, or the characterization of listening as reading, is not a contradiction. Listening is not “cheating,” or passive, or homogeneous, and it’s long been central to the interpretation of fiction. This seminar explores how and why by treating listening as a critical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll have the opportunity to test various approaches to listening by studying fiction (mostly Anglo-American) from the 20th and 21st centuries. To invite an array of expertise on the topic, I’ve selected a range of works that not only engage themes of sound and listening (as content) but also experiment with audio formats, such as radio plays, talking books, cut-ups, recorded readings, serialized drama, voice-over narration, and first-person videogames, where listeners cannot see the “source” of a sound. Each week, we’ll examine a work or two with a particular theme or technique in mind. Themes will include listening to writers read, listening to narrators speak, listening for meaning, listening for effects, listening with others, listening in place, listening against the grain, listening spheres, and listening with machines. Across them, we’ll consider the aesthetics and sensory politics of how readers listen to fiction and how fiction is composed to be heard. I’ll also encourage you to try writing for readers who are listening by asking you to develop a portfolio of audio work comprised of brief exercises that culminate in an episode for a podcast of your design about a seminar topic of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The only thing you should purchase (or rent) for this seminar is Toni Morrison’s &lt;em&gt;The Bluest Eye&lt;/em&gt; as an audiobook, where she is the reader and voice actress. You may want to grab a print copy, too. The remaining materials are available openly online, via UVic Libraries, or in Brightspace. I hope this approach keeps costs down for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of the primary materials I’ve assigned. They are intended to help us cover a range of audio and fiction, across formats, while grounding our research in questions of critical listening and its relation to reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audiobook: Toni Morrison’s &lt;em&gt;The Bluest Eye&lt;/em&gt; (1970)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recorded reading: Edwidge Danticat reading (2013) Jamaica Kincaid’s “Girl” (1978) and “Wingless” (1979)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Radio play: Samuel Beckett’s &lt;em&gt;All That Fall: A Play for Radio&lt;/em&gt; (1957)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sound art: Delia Derbyshire’s “Ziwzih Ziwzih OO-OO-OO” (1967), Alvin Lucier’s &lt;em&gt;I Am Sitting in a Room&lt;/em&gt; (1969-70),  King Tubby and The Aggrovators, “Dub Fi Gwan” (1977), and Laurie Anderson’s &lt;em&gt;O Superman&lt;/em&gt; (1981)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serialized audio drama: &lt;em&gt;Within the Wires&lt;/em&gt; (Season One, “Relaxation Cassettes”) (2016), by Jeffrey Cranor, Janina Matthewson, and Mary Epworth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Voice-over narration: performances by Regina King (2005), Edward Norton (1999), Christina Ricci (1998), and Sissy Spacek (1973)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First-person games: Giant Sparrow’s &lt;em&gt;What Remains of Edith Finch&lt;/em&gt; (2017) and Lucas Pope’s &lt;em&gt;Return of the Obra Dinn&lt;/em&gt; (2018)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your reference, I’ve also compiled a series of brief, critical introductions to listening and related issues. These introductions are written mostly from a sound studies angle, and you will find them in Brightspace or via UVic Libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;“Adequate Modes of Listening,” by Ola Stockfelt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recommend the website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundstudiesblog.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sounding Out!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, edited by Jennifer Lynn Stoever, as well as podcasts such as &lt;em&gt;SpokenWeb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Phantom Power&lt;/em&gt;. They are excellent resources for keeping up with audio, fiction, and sound studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for audio technologies that may be useful in this seminar, I recommend Audacity and some headphones or earbuds. You may want an external microphone as well, but that’s certainly optional. For more on gear, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://superbon.net/2020/08/13/recording-your-lectures-3-gear-gear-gear/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Jonathan Sterne or email me. I’m happy to talk more about the tech I use for audio work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Media Aesthetics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I taught a graduate seminar in Spring 2020 about mediation, fiction, and the fundamental question of how we even communicate. We studied radio drama, comics, interactive fiction, games, recorded readings, and speculative fiction from the 20th and 21st centuries to experiment with critical forms of play, listening, reading, watching, and looking. Our angle on it all was media aesthetics in the vein of Walter Benjamin (the politicization of aesthetics and the aestheticization of politics in particular). As we moved week to week across contexts and formats of fiction, we asked questions such as, “How are our experiences and interpretations of fiction mediated?” “How and under what assumptions do media like audio, images, and text measure and even discipline our perception?” “What if communication were something else?” I said “apparatus” a lot during those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar also acted as an introduction to media studies (or media praxis) for English MA and PhD students with interests in literature and theory since 1900. I structured it around some common questions and familiar statements (see image below) that spoke to the assigned content and also reflected how everyday communication is mediated. At the end of the course, students submitted a final project about an artistic or literary technique used to articulate media with fiction in the 20th and/or 21st century. Examples of those techniques included annotation, acousmatics, machine listening, procedural generation, simulation, and worldbuilding. Students used either 2500-4000 words (plus notes and references) or the equivalent across media (audio, video, image, text) for their projects. I asked them to identify potential publication venues (including but not limited to journals) and scaffold their research toward a final project by producing annotated bibliographies, co-facilitating seminar discussions, writing “genealogies” of their selected techniques, circulating 250-word abstracts, and presenting draft materials for peer feedback. The course shifted from in-person to online meetings in March to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to the course website, syllabus, and notes are below. I’ve included as well the course description and list of assigned materials that toggle between the first and second person for a student audience, and I point to a related talk I gave at the University of Puget Sound in 2018 on the topic of “Starting in the Middle.” Many thanks to everyone who participated in this seminar. The discussions were lively, and the projects were brill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Aesthetics: Media and Fiction since 1900&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
Spring 2020 | UVic English 506 | Grad seminar for 12 students&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/506/&quot;&gt;course website&lt;/a&gt; (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/506/506Spring2020syllabus.pdf&quot;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt; (PDF); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/506/index.html#notes&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;/blog.html#starting-in-the-middle&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; at Puget Sound (HTML); resources related to &lt;a href=&quot;/mediatheory&quot;&gt;“Reading Media in Theory”&lt;/a&gt; (HTML) and &lt;a href=&quot;/designingcourses&quot;&gt;“Designing Grad Courses”&lt;/a&gt; (HTML)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Seminar&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;
Media are frequently treated as means in the business of making records. They help to verify communication occurred. &lt;em&gt;Did you get my message?&lt;/em&gt; They also help to confirm meaning. &lt;em&gt;Do you understand it?&lt;/em&gt; Such treatments tend to economize experience. Media should, for instance, facilitate the seizure and extraction of information. &lt;em&gt;Take a video. Capture some audio. Grab an image before it’s gone.&lt;/em&gt; They should function as proof. &lt;em&gt;I saw this. I heard that. I was there.&lt;/em&gt; They should be efficient. &lt;em&gt;Give me the tl;dr.&lt;/em&gt; They should secure consensus. &lt;em&gt;Don’t you agree?&lt;/em&gt; And they should accumulate and produce value. &lt;em&gt;Am I on brand?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seminar accounts for the records business to move beyond it. That move is called “media aesthetics.” Step one is speculation, and step two is attending to an apparatus—from economical communication to possible communications to how we even communicate. If economical communication verifies occurrence and confirms understanding, then speculation operates in the subjunctive. &lt;em&gt;What if communication were something else?&lt;/em&gt; Here, resistance, refusal, storytelling, and figurative language become potential alternatives to economized experience, as each may brush against the desire for efficiency. An apparatus prompts us to consider why and how. It joins the economical with the subjunctive by producing relations between them. An apparatus is not some underlying structure or ideal form. It’s an agent for content and design, and it’s often right in front us, like an interface—there, yet impossible to grasp. During seminar, I’ll suggest that the key ingredients of an apparatus are &lt;em&gt;measurement, movement, sense, and making sense&lt;/em&gt;, and we’ll assess how apparatuses discipline and standardize experience while affording experimentation and speculation. We’ll examine five apparatuses in particular (grids, editors, networks, stacks, and engines), though we’ll need something to ground us and all our abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else but fiction to put us on the same page? We’ll study media through discussions of radio dramas, fantasy, science fiction, comics, games, and experimental literature from the 20th and 21st centuries. Call it escapism, if you wish; however, these fictions will be quite useful for understanding apparatuses and the economization of experience today. For one, they will nudge us to listen, watch, see, and play as well as read. They will also position audio, image, and text as &lt;em&gt;congealed labour&lt;/em&gt;: processes and techniques rather than objects and instruments. From this position, we’ll approach aesthetics as a question of embodied perception and sensation, and we’ll talk about how some experiences of fiction are singular and others are shared. Fiction will also be a site for speculation and worldbuilding, and for stressing why both the content and design of the subjunctive matter. We’ll ask what audio, image, and text mean and verify in fiction, but also what they do and, if you’re so inclined, what they want. Perhaps most important, we’ll consider aesthetics and politics together. How and under what assumptions are media and fiction categorized? How do media encourage and even rationalize particular ways of engaging fiction? How do we compose with, against, and even beyond the apparatuses that dominate cultural production?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a technical course. The assignments are open to media practice (such as the composition of audio and video) without requiring it. The seminar does not involve any quantitative or computational methods, either. By “media,” I mean “audio, image, and text,” not “the media” or mass communications and their outlets. And by “media aesthetics,” I mean the practice of evaluating how design and content are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced. In this case, we’ll evaluate the design and content of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please purchase Alison Bechdel’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/bechdel/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It should be at the UVic Bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend purchasing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emil Ferris’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fantagraphics.com/my-favorite-thing-is-monsters/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Favorite Thing Is Monsters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (also at the UVic Bookstore)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;N.K. Jemisin’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-fifth-season/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fifth Season&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toby Fox and Temmie Chang’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://undertale.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fullbright’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gonehome.game/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside these materials, I’ve dedicated a section of the syllabus to &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/506/index.html#notes&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll populate that section as the term unfolds. I don’t plan to use slides during seminar; however, I will include in our discussions various snippets of audio, image, and text from assigned fictions. As you study them, I recommend doing the same: consider screengrabs, sound clips, photographs, video, and whatnot for your own records and reference. If you’d like advice on archiving and annotating media, then let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that most of the assigned materials are from the 21st century. I made these selections in part because I think (or hope) they will spark some engaging, if not pressing, seminar discussions about speculation and the apparatuses of media and fiction; however, we’ll still account for history in this course. For instance, during most modules I’ll provide overviews of where the assigned materials “fit,” and how, in media, fiction, and theory since 1900. I should also mention that my selections reflect an investment in narrative and storytelling. I did not include, for example, any artist’s books or poetry, both of which are obviously relevant to studies of media and literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, see the &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/506&quot;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt; for the course.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Praxis Studio</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies is a humanities research lab dedicated to the aesthetics and politics of media across formats. It is a space with an infrastructure. It is also a culture, or—as our researchers are wont to describe it—a “pond” for experimental methods that blend media theory with media practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Studio was once the &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;Maker Lab&lt;/a&gt;. I changed the name and unbranded our research in 2019, and we relocated that same year, with a shift toward &lt;a href=&quot;/minimalcomputing&quot;&gt;minimal computing&lt;/a&gt; techniques along the way. This means we invest in research activities that demand fewer resources, not to mention less technical labor and maintenance, than the MLab’s previous physical computing, fabrication, and multimodal communication projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Studio is also intended to support students first and foremost. Whereas the MLab privileged milestone-driven research toward a specific “kit” or exhibition, the Praxis team follows lines of inquiry clustered loosely around annual themes. Students may develop their own research with feedback from the group, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they may collaborate on projects in partnership with local communities and networks such as &lt;a href=&quot;/spokenweb&quot;&gt;SpokenWeb&lt;/a&gt;. All Praxis work belongs to our researchers (not to the Studio), and no position is unpaid. I also do my best to host visiting speakers and facilitate Studio events like our 2021-22 “Player Stories” series about how people study play, document it, and narrate their experiences with games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an official description of the Praxis Studio, together with links to its website, its Twitter handle, and related information about Studio grants, events, and partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While directing the Studio, I’ve had the honor of collaborating with this incredible crew: Samuel Adesubokan, Tracey El Hajj, Julie M. Funk, Braeden Hallman, Stefan Higgins, Madyson Huck, Hector Lopez, Faith Ryan, Alana Sayers, Lexy Townsend, and Asia Tyson. A thousand thanks to you all! And additional thanks to Asia for giving me permission to include the image below of her Praxis work on player stories and game audio. Here, Asia is studying the game, &lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt;, developed and published by Playdead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund, and UVic’s Faculty of Humanities and Department of English&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who We Are&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;
We are a group of researchers who study the aesthetics and politics of media by blending theory and history with storytelling and prototyping. We value decolonization, situated knowledge, the space of place, and integrative approaches to media: old + new, analog + digital, still + moving, popular + experimental, immersive + meta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Do&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
We identify pressing topics in media studies, articulate them as studio themes, research and write about them, prototype scenarios for them, and facilitate events to engage them. Our themes have included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Player Stories: examining how people document and narrate their experiences with games&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uncanning Sounds: bringing literary audio from the past into the present&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experimental Worldbuilding: imagining better worlds for games and playable fictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Aren’t&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
We are not a blog, brand, dev team, fab lab, digital humanities project, or humanities computing centre. We do not offer courses, either, but if you want to learn about digital tools and methodologies, then we recommend contacting our amazing colleagues at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/dsc/&quot;&gt;Digital Scholarship Commons&lt;/a&gt; (DSC), &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocam.library.uvic.ca/index.php&quot;&gt;Obsolete Computing and Media&lt;/a&gt; (OCaM), and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/hcmc/&quot;&gt;Humanities Computing and Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; (HCMC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support and History&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
We are housed in the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Victoria; we partner with English, Visual Arts, the HCMC, and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought; and we collaborate with the DSC and Special Collections. We are members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spokenweb.ca/&quot;&gt;SpokenWeb&lt;/a&gt; project, and our research is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and the SpokenWeb SSHRC partnership network. We began as The Maker Lab in the Humanities in 2012 and became The Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies in 2019. All work belongs to our researchers (not to the studio), and no position is unpaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact Us&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
We’re located in UVic’s Clearihue building. You can email our director, Jentery Sayers (he/him/his), at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jentery@uvic.ca&quot;&gt;jentery@uvic.ca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SpokenWeb</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/praxis&quot;&gt;Praxis Studio&lt;/a&gt; partnered with the SpokenWeb research network in 2019 and has since continued to develop pedagogical materials for teaching and learning about literary sound recordings and audio in the humanities. Some examples include Julie Funk’s research on machine listening (and listening like a machine), Samuel Adesubokan’s annotations of talking drum performances by the Peter Adedokun ensemble, Faith Ryan’s treatment of listening as a question of access, and the Studio’s ongoing work to create prompts that introduce undergraduates to the apprehension and interpretation of audio in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a link to SpokenWeb, followed by an official description of both the network and its pedagogy task force, of which I’m a member. I also point to an interview that SpokenWeb’s Emma Telaro conducted with Julie, Faith, and me and to some audio-related talks the Studio’s researchers gave in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to SpokenWeb’s principal investigator, Jason Camlot, not only for his leadership but also for inviting the Praxis Studio to join SpokenWeb; to Karis Shearer, Deanna Fong, Michelle Levy, Emily Murphy, Jason Wiens, and everyone on SpokenWeb’s pedagogy task force; and to SpokenWeb and SSHRC for supporting the following research assistants at UVic: Samuel Adesubokan, Julie Funk, Stefan Higgins, Madyson Huck, Faith Ryan, and Asia Tyson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), in particular through the SpokenWeb SSHRC partnership network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About SpokenWeb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of portable tape recording media technologies in the 1960s, writers and artists have been documenting their performances of literary works, events and conversations with creative abandon. Yet, most of these audio archives remain inaccessible or in peril of imminent decay, or, if digitized, are still largely disconnected from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SSHRC-funded SpokenWeb partnership aims to develop coordinated and collaborative approaches to literary historical study, digital development, and critical and pedagogical engagement with diverse collections of literary sound recordings from across Canada and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These approaches include 1) new forms of historical and critical scholarly engagement; 2) digital preservation and aggregation techniques, asset management and infrastructure to support sustainable access; 3) techniques and tools for searching, visualizing, analyzing and enhancing critical engagement (for features relevant to humanities research and pedagogy); and 4) innovative ways of mobilizing digitized spoken and literary recordings within pedagogical, performative and public contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SpokenWeb program begins with the preservation and description of sonic artifacts that have captured literary events of the past, and quickly moves into a wide range of approaches and activities activate these artifacts in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The SpokenWeb’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://spokenweb.ca/about-us/spokenweb/&quot;&gt;“About” page&lt;/a&gt; is the source of this description.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pedagogy Task Force&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pedagogy Task Force aims to produce research outputs (conferences, publications, and workshops) that enhance engagement with existing digital audio archives or analog collections. Our research and projects can be described by the following five categories: 1) development of pedagogical training modules &amp;amp; resources that can be shared amongst partners as well as with the public, 2) development of digital tools for use in classroom and public pedagogy, 3) development of a bank of pedagogical activities and resources that can be used by members of the SpokenWeb team and by teachers in a variety of settings, 4) knowledge production and mobilization on pedagogical theory and practice, and 5) identification and tagging of pedagogical content of recordings within the SpokenWeb member collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The SpokenWeb’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://spokenweb.ca/about-us/governance/&quot;&gt;“Governance” page&lt;/a&gt; is the source of this description.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tabletop Inquiry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This document (also available in &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/resources/tabletopInquiry.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) is a reflection on &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/syllabi/508v4/&quot;&gt;“Paper Computers”&lt;/a&gt; (UVic English, Fall 2018), a graduate seminar on prototyping tabletop games informed by literary and media history. It is intended to be a resource for people who are interested in prototyping tabletop games as a form of critical inquiry. It builds on &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/syllabi/508v4/keywords.html&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; from the seminar, and it shaped the composition of this &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/syllabi/508v4/handoutHSVisit22Feb2019.pdf&quot;&gt;handout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/talks/connectu/&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; for people who are new to tabletop games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document consists of three point-form lists. The first is a series of observations made while studying and prototyping paper computers this semester (Fall 2018); it distills and documents some of our conversations in the seminar. The second list outlines some questions prompted by tabletop prototyping for project design in the humanities; it highlights how tabletop prototyping may apply to a broader set of research practices (not just to games). The third list itemizes types of prototypes for engaging history; it offers a working vocabulary for prototyping as a form of criticism. Please note that this reflection is not meant to cohere. Pardon the contradictions and any typos, and thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term, “paper computer,” was coined by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/kirschenbaumWar.pdf&quot;&gt;Matthew Kirschenbaum&lt;/a&gt; to describe tabletop games (wargames, in particular). We used it to also describe paper as a medium for storage, processing, and experimentation, including experiments with play, procedural thinking, and algorithmic production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;observations&quot;&gt;Observations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Terms such as “interactive media” are common in media studies, where “interactive” may imply responding to people’s decisions with automatically generated output. But “automated” and “responsive” are not synonymous with “interactive,” and &lt;em&gt;interaction is not baked into media&lt;/em&gt;. It is a relation, not some quality of an object. Tables or paper may afford as much interaction as screens or software. The aims and conditions of interaction, including who and what are interacting, shape its definition. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/gitelmanShortHistory.pdf&quot;&gt;Gitelman&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/druckerAB.pdf&quot;&gt;Drucker&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immersion is not baked into media, either. &lt;em&gt;Repetition, flow, and engagement depend on context and interest.&lt;/em&gt; While some people may be immersed in rulebooks, others may be immersed in oral stories. Even if media envelop us (e.g., virtual reality and theatre), experiences of them may be alienating, distracting, or uncomfortable. Of course, immersion is also a strategy for producing dedicated consumer bases, who binge and buy expansions. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/kirschenbaumWar.pdf&quot;&gt;Kirschenbaum&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tabletop handbooks and game manuals are entry points into the opaque worlds of algorithms (i.e., procedures or formulas for conducting specific actions), and thus prototyping game rules may foster procedural literacy without requiring computer programming. &lt;em&gt;Paper games are low-tech computers, where people not only convert input into output but also translate game states into game views&lt;/em&gt;. While algorithms may shape and even determine decision-making, they are also used for craft, play, and storytelling. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/&quot;&gt;Alder&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cephalofair.com/gloomhaven&quot;&gt;Childres&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/debord-ai&quot;&gt;Galloway&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/kirschenbaumWar.pdf&quot;&gt;Kirschenbaum&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/12544152.0001.001/--pastplay-teaching-and-learning-history-with-technology?g=dculture;trgt=div2_ch7;view=fulltext;xc=1&quot;&gt;Nowviskie&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The word “digital” may be misleading or reductive. Not all electronic computing is digital, and not all paper computing is analogue. More important, paper computing shows how &lt;em&gt;most novelty associated with digital media and culture predates personal computing and the internet&lt;/em&gt;. We might therefore ask how today’s use of “digital” is value-laden: less about material or historical particulars and more about buzz and markets. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/chunNewMedia.pdf&quot;&gt;Chun&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/flanaganBoardGames.pdf&quot;&gt;Flanagan&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper computing asserts the centrality of embodied labour&lt;/em&gt; to histories of science and technology. The work of paper processing and maintenance often goes unattributed and is routinely gendered and racialized in the name of lone male invention. Roberto Busa, for instance, did not credit the female punch-card operators who were his associates, while Josephine Miles did credit her collaborators. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://melissaterras.blogspot.com/2013/10/for-ada-lovelace-day-father-busas.html&quot;&gt;Terras&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/search-and-replace&quot;&gt;Buurma and Heffernan&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designers do not argue for an actual boundary between games and the outside world. &lt;em&gt;The “magic circle” does not exist in any scientific or empirical sense&lt;/em&gt; (hence the word, “magic”); however, it is a common device for believability and trust. It is also used to test and sell games, and to produce meaning through play. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/135063/jerked_around_by_the_magic_circle_.php&quot;&gt;Zimmerman&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://theenemyreader.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Hammer_Baker_The_Enemy.pdf&quot;&gt;Hammer and Baker&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tabletop games manipulate space and time. Most obviously, they cast progress through tracks and counters, and they sculpt space through boards and miniatures. Yet &lt;em&gt;tabletop games also shape how time and space are perceived and experienced.&lt;/em&gt; Stewart: “30 minutes would be experienced in 5 minutes at 1/12 scale and in 2.5 minutes at 1/24 scale” (66). (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/stewartOnLonging.pdf&quot;&gt;Stewart&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewonderofminiatures.com/2015/05/20/miniature-manifesto-part-1-call-us-makers/&quot;&gt;Krasniewicz&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Histories of tabletop games correspond with histories of manifestos, artists’ books, and zines&lt;/em&gt;, especially since the 1850s. Each involves experiments with paper and, more generally, mediation, even though their audiences and cultures differ. Each is also a medium for “action writing,” which either prompts actions or contains charged design elements. But, with the exception of Surrealism and Situationism, tabletop games are usually ignored in histories of the “avant-garde.” (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/cawsManifesto.pdf&quot;&gt;Caws&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/druckerAB.pdf&quot;&gt;Drucker&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/radwayZines.pdf&quot;&gt;Radway&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/26/bookend/bookend.html&quot;&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perhaps ironically, &lt;em&gt;both critical play and magic circles may resist cultures of 24/7 work, productivity, and attention economics&lt;/em&gt;. For many people, play is essential to self-care and community; for others, it is a form of subversion (e.g., against gamification); it is also a way to escape into intense focus and dedication (e.g., campaigns). Dismissing it outright as “uncritical” or “complicit” bypasses its nuance, or at least people’s needs and desires for leisure and social activity. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/flanaganIntroCP.pdf&quot;&gt;Flanagan&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledge.com/Digital-Labor-The-Internet-as-Playground-and-Factory/Scholz/p/book/9780415896955&quot;&gt;Scholz&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upne.com/1584655828.html&quot;&gt;Beller&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://theenemyreader.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Hammer_Baker_The_Enemy.pdf&quot;&gt;Hammer and Baker&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The themes and mechanics of tabletop games frequently resemble the aesthetics and techniques of science fiction and fantasy. Here, &lt;em&gt;speculation should not be relegated to whimsy.&lt;/em&gt; Delany: “one cannot revise an image until one has an image to revise. . . . If you don’t see it, you can’t work for it” (31). (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/delanyTomorrows.pdf&quot;&gt;Delany&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://theenemyreader.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Hammer_Baker_The_Enemy.pdf&quot;&gt;Hammer and Baker&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The practices of writing, storytelling, and design address someone; however, &lt;em&gt;the notion of “users” is extremely limited.&lt;/em&gt; It tends to flatten subjectivity and be market-driven. It may also ignore strategies of mis- or non-use. And yet alternative terms, such as “audiences,” “consumers,” and “players,” may be no better. Ditto with the term, “gamers,” which can be both homogenizing and exclusionary. People may be interested in games without identifying as gamers, or they may be curious about games but skeptical of gaming cultures. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/burdickMeta.pdf&quot;&gt;Burdick&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tor.com/2015/04/27/why-minority-settings-in-rpgs-matter/%22&quot;&gt;Beltrán&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tabletop cultures, design studies, and critical theory are all discourse communities with their own lexicons and rules, which people use to belong &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to police. Even though media are irreducible to language (e.g., they are more than what people say about them), the creation and persistence of discourse communities matter for media practice and culture. &lt;em&gt;Alternative approaches to games, design, and theory often require new discourse communities.&lt;/em&gt; Language is a type of action. (See &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/syllabi/508v4/keywords.html#game-speak&quot;&gt;Game Speak&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/syllabi/508v4/keywords.html#design-speak&quot;&gt;Design Speak&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/syllabi/508v4/keywords.html#theory-speak&quot;&gt;Theory Speak&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The politics of tabletop games emerge through both mechanics and themes. Consider the colonialism of settler themes and area control mechanics, the cisheteronormativity of many romance themes, the default whiteness of most character art and settings, the ableism of movement programming, the capitalism of auction and accumulation mechanics, the proliferation of predominantly white male conventions and gaming groups . . . Players not only read game rules and learn themes but also perform and inhabit their dynamics, and most games do not assume critical positions on history or power. Yet many designers, including indie designers, are working to change games from the inside, and the arts and humanities have much to contribute to this process. Change happens through themes, mechanics, and representation as well as culture, habits, and markets. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://analoggamestudies.org/2016/03/indigenous-board-game-design-in-the-gift-of-food/&quot;&gt;LaPensée&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://decolonizingpractices.org/&quot;&gt;Nahanee&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tor.com/2015/04/27/why-minority-settings-in-rpgs-matter/%22&quot;&gt;Beltrán&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaihs.org/seriously-boardgames-yes-seriously/&quot;&gt;Rael&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pwp.gatech.edu/suffragetto/&quot;&gt;Shelby&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/valens116&quot;&gt;Valens&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackgreengames.com/about/&quot;&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://theenemyreader.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Hammer_Baker_The_Enemy.pdf&quot;&gt;Hammer and Baker&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;prompts-for-project-design&quot;&gt;Prompts for Project Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;When might low-tech or lo-fi approaches be useful?&lt;/em&gt; Design often starts with software or programming, which may involve steep learning curves. Low-tech approaches, such as wireframing or paper prototyping, not to mention text editors and mobile phones, may help people to focus more on core concepts and experiences. They may also help people to reduce the scope and feature creep common to many tools and platforms. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/burdickMeta.pdf&quot;&gt;Burdick&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/krausFaultlines.pdf&quot;&gt;Kraus&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How is project design also inquiry?&lt;/em&gt; Rather than treating the design process as a trivial or routinized means to an end (namely, the creation of product), iteration may think through (or with, or against) techniques and materials. After all, design happens &lt;em&gt;in medias res&lt;/em&gt;. It can also function as ontological theatre: the use of scenarios, media, or performance to stage engagement and experimentation instead of re-presentation. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/rosnerDesign.pdf&quot;&gt;Rosner&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/krausFaultlines.pdf&quot;&gt;Kraus&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo8169881.html&quot;&gt;Pickering&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do projects prompt speculations about the past?&lt;/em&gt; Speculation may brush against tendencies to “discover” materials, “reveal” truths, explain away the ghosts, and make “claims” with computers. It privileges contingency of relations &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; responsibility for distinctions made, without reducing research to interpretative abandon. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/krausFaultlines.pdf&quot;&gt;Kraus&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/speculative-everything&quot;&gt;Dunne and Raby&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/lukensDisalvoDesign.pdf&quot;&gt;Lukens and DiSalvo&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do projects remediate or transform historical materials, and how are they conscious of and responsible for those changes?&lt;/em&gt; Remediation necessarily affects the composition and interpretation of the past, yet it also shapes people’s sense of immediacy and hypermediacy. It demands attention to provenance and attribution as well. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/remediation&quot;&gt;Bolter and Grusin&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/samuelsMcGannDeformance.pdf&quot;&gt;Samuels and McGann&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/debord-ai&quot;&gt;Galloway&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://humangames.lab.uiowa.edu/games/mark&quot;&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SfNJ3P-07ngHakJAHNKaTCDYYSvZDBxr0i_MCctRsbs/edit&quot;&gt;Hansen and Kraus&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/konkolLoy.pdf&quot;&gt;Konkol&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pwp.gatech.edu/suffragetto/&quot;&gt;Shelby&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do projects engage historical materials through “design for effect” (what happened) and “design for cause” (why something happened)?&lt;/em&gt; Examining both approaches acknowledges project design as a phenomenological and epistemological process. It also helps people to distinguish between simulating, reconstructing, and prototyping the past. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulsiphergames.com/Articles/DesigningforCausevsEffect.htm&quot;&gt;Pulsipher&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/kirschenbaumWar.pdf&quot;&gt;Kirschenbaum&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do projects organize information?&lt;/em&gt; Consider the five hat racks: similarity, time, location, alphabet, and continuum / magnitude. Also consider how text is a visual medium (and not just words). It is designed through layout and typography; it is arranged and used, not just seen and read. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.ca/books?id=zUhiAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;q=five+hat+racks+design+principle++Wurman&amp;amp;dq=five+hat+racks+design+principle++Wurman&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwil3NWN84bfAhWDOn0KHcxMDcYQ6AEIKjAA&quot;&gt;Wurman&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/gitelmanShortHistory.pdf&quot;&gt;Gitelman&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/search-and-replace&quot;&gt;Buurma and Heffernan&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do projects rely on alphabetic language(s), and which language(s)?&lt;/em&gt; Some areas of design consider the degree to which a project works across or without alphabetic languages. For example, “language independence” relies heavily on icons to facilitate interpretation. These practices also raise questions about the dominance of English in media production.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do embodied dynamics (such as play, interaction, and interpretation) entwine aesthetics with mechanics?&lt;/em&gt; Engagement is not disembodied, and mechanics do not always determine use. Attention to embodied dynamics also underscores the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/&quot;&gt;accessibility&lt;/a&gt; to design. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/hunickeMDA.pdf&quot;&gt;Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are projects documented, and with which futures in mind?&lt;/em&gt; Design documents and repositories present a narrative about how this became that. Although they share process, they are also crafted and edited. They do not “capture” what actually happened so much as communicate a framed story of development. That story and its contents may be re-used or re-purposed by others in the future, and the needs and interests of future audiences are not easy to anticipate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do projects progressively disclose information?&lt;/em&gt; Not all of the project’s material can (and probably shouldn’t) be presented from the start. What is disclosed, how, when, and where says a lot about a project and its approach to performance load and argumentation. Also, projects may benefit from extending tasks or events (e.g., legacy games). The Zeigarnik effect claims that interrupted or incomplete tasks are better remembered than completed tasks. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-007-9036-7&quot;&gt;Lidwell, Holden, and Butler&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are projects tested?&lt;/em&gt; All too often, projects are designed without situations of use in mind; they may be driven by abstract or ideal notions of their audiences and contexts. Alternatives include sharing projects before they’re ready, observing (like a fly on the wall) how people interact with drafts and prototypes, and prompting people to reach specific results or conclusions. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://playtestingworkshops.com/&quot;&gt;Hammer et al.&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do we study the expected and unexpected use patterns (“wear and tear”) of projects?&lt;/em&gt; Repeated use is often associated with maintenance rehearsal, whereas elaborative rehearsal may involve misuse, repurposing, modding, and “desire lines” (creative shortcuts). Designs may encourage both maintenance and elaborative rehearsal as types of use. Not all uses must be anticipated or expected, and project design can be described as facilitation (e.g., providing context) instead of control. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/krausFaultlines.pdf&quot;&gt;Kraus&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-007-9036-7&quot;&gt;Lidwell, Holden, and Butler&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;types-of-prototypes&quot;&gt;Types of Prototypes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some types of prototypes for engaging history. I’ve used the framework of “source materials,” but perhaps you prefer “texts” or the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imitation&lt;/em&gt; (labour of source material): to better understand the composition of source material by learning the techniques involved in its production&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgery&lt;/em&gt; (economy of source material): to better understand the public perception and/or value of source material by learning the techniques involved in its production, but with intent to either deceive or reveal deception&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario&lt;/em&gt; (interaction with source material): to better understand how people may ultimately interpret source material by situating it in contexts of use and then observing those uses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story&lt;/em&gt; (performance of source material): to better understand how source material gains cultural traction or builds identity by treating it as a script and performing it on or off record&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterfactual&lt;/em&gt; (norms or conditions of source material): to better understand the biases of source material (or common interpretations of it) by constructing “what-if” alternatives to specific aspects of its history, content, or composition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model&lt;/em&gt; (logic or conventions of source material): to better understand the mode, form, genre, scale, or design of source material by rendering it as an abstraction, using it to alter other source materials (or aspects of itself), and determining why the changes are interesting (if at all)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wish&lt;/em&gt; (ideology of source material): to better understand the worldviews, belief systems, or desires of source material by increasing/decreasing their frequency, reversing them, or otherwise manipulating them and then determining why the changes are interesting (if at all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototyping may be considered a form of criticism that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performs a method or physically &lt;em&gt;manifests a way of reading&lt;/em&gt; through techniques such as imitation, alteration, scripting, repetition, simulation, recontextualization, modelling, counterfactuals, ruination, and trial-and-error testing, to name a few.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is interpreted or assessed based on its &lt;em&gt;effectiveness as an experiment&lt;/em&gt;, or how persuasively it changes or isolates the systems through which materials and contexts afford meaning. Such systems may include matters of perception (e.g., how materials are seen or engaged), semantics (e.g., how signifiers relate and produce meaning), aesthetics (e.g., how materials are arranged and composed), politics (e.g., how materials enable or are embedded in ideologies), history (e.g., how materials are anchored in time and space but also move across them), matter (e.g., the stuff of which materials are made), and want or need (e.g., wishes, desires, uses, and applications).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expresses a form or model, which foregrounds use and &lt;em&gt;prompts specific actions&lt;/em&gt;. Such actions may include writing in a margin or blank space, entering data, replying to a message, fixing a bug, following steps, signing, clicking, copying, pasting, deleting, scanning, redacting, searching, tagging, spamming, non-communication (e.g., in the case of frustration, silence, or confusion), or simply listening, watching, or reading. The consequences of these actions are not always predictable. In fact, the most persuasive prototypes foster surprise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Articulates language and meaning with matter. While prototypes are conceptual, they demonstrate (as opposed to re-present) how concepts &lt;em&gt;work through materials&lt;/em&gt; and settings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suggests or conjectures something instead of proving it. That is, a prototype is a &lt;em&gt;situation for interpretation&lt;/em&gt;, not a standalone object. Meaning is an effect of experimentation, not an ingredient of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Imagines a solution or &lt;em&gt;scenario&lt;/em&gt; to examine the results. Such scenarios may include improving features of source material, stewarding it into the present, remediating it, remaking it, repairing it, or (to demonstrate why it was persuasive in the first place) ruining it. Any of these practices may experiment with alternate histories, probable futures, adjacent possibilities, or absences in the archive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Often uses &lt;em&gt;ephemerality as a medium&lt;/em&gt;. That is, it tends to be more interested in what escapes than what persists. Here, we may consider how interactions, interfaces, performances, rhythms, impressions, feelings, and affects escape the record or are difficult to “capture” with technologies. Put this way, loss is not necessarily an anxiety or emphasis. Change becomes the most interesting or suggestive element of creativity and criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototyping also asks how source materials address us (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/1771&quot;&gt;Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials function as public documents, intended for passersby. Here, negative space, lines, typefaces, and font sizes are especially important (e.g., graphic design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants your attention&lt;/em&gt;. It is charged. It is read from a distance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials become symbols, intended for extended observation. Here, the form or “face” across components is key (e.g., topography). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to escape reality&lt;/em&gt;. It welds feeling with arrangement, against the reduction of signs to mere vehicles for meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials manifest ways of reading, intended for familiarization or defamiliarization. Here, orientation, embodiment, and eye movement are most significant (e.g., interface design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to afford certain readings&lt;/em&gt;. It influences or even structures vision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials create relations with other materials, intended for the production or analysis of patterns. Here, juxtaposition and reference are central (e.g., interaction design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be an index&lt;/em&gt;, with readers traversing across (or toggling between) it and something else. It connects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are proof, intended as evidence. Here, the truth claims are emphasized (e.g., forensics). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be a record&lt;/em&gt;. It is like a photograph or signature. It points or demonstrates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are objects or commodities, intended for collection and exhibition. Here, the value, availability, and economy of materials are privileged (e.g., book arts). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be displayed&lt;/em&gt;. People travel to witness the original. Something about it cannot be copied.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are scans, intended primarily for access on screen. Here, recognition, formats, and relations between witnesses, editions, originals, and copies are the focus (e.g., versioning). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be found or archived&lt;/em&gt;. It is its legibility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are edges, intended to produce boundaries. Here, page size, margins, paper, screens, and canvases matter (e.g., layout design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to frame language and reading&lt;/em&gt;. It demarcates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are windows or portals, intended for transparency. Here, clarity is everything (e.g., instrumental design). The material &lt;em&gt;gives people want they want or expect&lt;/em&gt;. It is a vehicle for exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are mirrors, intended for reflection or re-presentation. Here, a lack of ornament, a use of familiar features, and an insistence on accuracy of perspective are significant (e.g., isomorphic design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to express the world precisely and/or prompt awareness&lt;/em&gt; (or social- or self-awareness). It hails.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are tactile, intended for handling and touching. Here, texture is paramount (e.g., materials design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be tangible&lt;/em&gt;, or it does not want to be behind glass or screen. It exposes the limits of vision and ocularcentrism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are processes, intended to resist alienation or abstraction. Here, composition, traces of interaction, gradual change, and the time spent making, reproducing, preserving, and disposing are most important (e.g., labour studies). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be a verb&lt;/em&gt;. It is mutable. It decays, rots, morphs, grows. It is also linked to various “invisible” contributors and acts of production.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are dogma, intended for followers. Here, lists, point form, and order are foregrounded (e.g., litany). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be copied&lt;/em&gt;, distributed, consulted, and observed. It directs or guides.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are policy or law, intended for nations, citizens, or employees. Here, an absence of aesthetics, a lack of variation, or an assertion of consistency is crucial (e.g., protocol). The material does not want to be an image. It &lt;em&gt;wants to be code or procedure&lt;/em&gt;, with a standard. It is executable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Before You Make a Thing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This resource (also available in &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/resources/beforeYouMakeAThing.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) is a guide for Technology and Society 200 (Fall 2018; 60 undergraduate students), &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/syllabi/200/&quot;&gt;“Prototyping Pasts and Futures,”&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Victoria. It consists of three point-form lists. The first is a series of theories and concepts drawn from assigned readings, the second is a rundown of practices corresponding with projects we studied, and the third itemizes prototyping techniques conducted in the course. All are intended to distill material from the term and communicate its relevance to project design and development. Although it’s written for a specific course, I hope it’s useful in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#theories-and-concepts&quot;&gt;Theories and Concepts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#practices&quot;&gt;Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#prototyping-techniques&quot;&gt;Prototyping Techniques&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;theories-and-concepts&quot;&gt;Theories and Concepts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Approach technologies as congealed labour; doing so expands what “technology” means and underscores the embodied work and material histories at play from ideation and patenting to manufacturing and maintenance. Technologies are not only things; they are processes, too. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/essay/labor/&quot;&gt;Mayer&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://amodern.net/article/optophonic-reading/&quot;&gt;reading optophone&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://anatomyof.ai/&quot;&gt;Crawford and Joler&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask who benefits most from automation and novelty; doing so attends to how planned obsolescence and deskilling affect various groups of people. Automation may increase efficiency or productivity in some areas, but it most certainly shapes craft as well as demands for particular occupations and forms of expertise. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/technology/&quot;&gt;Luddites&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://anatomyof.ai/&quot;&gt;Crawford and Joler&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.molleindustria.org/to-build-a-better-mousetrap/&quot;&gt;Pedercini&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognize when projects aestheticize the politics of their technologies; doing so addresses how values are expressed through design as well as through terms such as “user-friendly,” “fast,” “sleek,” “convenient,” and even “minimalist.” Design may be politics by seemingly apolitical means. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/parker-cold-dark-matter-an-exploded-view-t06949/story-cold-dark-matter&quot;&gt;Parker&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/digital/&quot;&gt;McPherson&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://anatomyof.ai/&quot;&gt;Crawford and Joler&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engage directly the power of technology; doing so foregrounds how and why a given technology could oppress groups of people, or be used to resist oppression. Technology is not only an object but also a force, and it is entangled with issues of race, gender, sexuality, extraction, and ability. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/media/&quot;&gt;Nakamura&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alondranelson.com/books/afrofuturism&quot;&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nothing-to-hide-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.molleindustria.org/to-build-a-better-mousetrap/&quot;&gt;Pedercini&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examine the “default settings” of technologies; doing so asks for whom, by whom, and under what assumptions they are designed, and who they may exclude and enable. All projects have intended audiences, even if those intentions are not always conscious or deliberate. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timetravellertm.com/episodes/episode04.html&quot;&gt;Skawennati&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alondranelson.com/books/afrofuturism&quot;&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/media/&quot;&gt;Nakamura&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid flattening society to a market or venue for products; doing so recognizes how social norms, contexts, and behaviours shape production, too. Society is a generalization and abstraction as well as a situation and practice that influences technologies. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/society/&quot;&gt;Hendler&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/digital/&quot;&gt;McPherson&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to locate technologies in their supply chains; doing so addresses their dependencies and conditions of production, not to mention people’s complicity with anonymous materials. Technologies persist within and through vast and complex infrastructures, which are incredibly difficult to study. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.molleindustria.org/to-build-a-better-mousetrap/&quot;&gt;Pedercini&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://anatomyof.ai/&quot;&gt;Crawford and Joler&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/leguin.pdf&quot;&gt;Le Guin&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pair “media” (plural) with “the media” (singular); doing so affords an understanding of the relationships between content and a platform, messages and a network, formats and a venue, communications and an outlet, representation and a system. Media may be windows (through), portals (to), frames (around), links (between), containers (in), addresses (at), negotiations (with), agents (for), and records (of). (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/media/&quot;&gt;Nakamura&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nothing-to-hide-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/sullivan.pdf&quot;&gt;Sullivan et al.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/essay/space/&quot;&gt;Morgan-Parmett&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Note the everyday aspects of technology; doing so stresses the centrality of habits and standards to development. Consider, for instance, how QWERTY shapes your language and writing habits, or how HTTP protocols control the web. Technologies are not only whiz-bang spectacles but also humdrum routines; most of the time, they are rather boring. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/borges.pdf&quot;&gt;Borges&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c539cK58ees&quot;&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider parthood alongside forms and wholes; doing so traces the components of technologies in archives and collections as well as in patents and claims. Technologies don’t descend from the sky or spring from the minds of lone inventors; they are assembled and maintained. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QSHZ20MQfE&quot;&gt;Tennis for Two&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75UrxueiP-4&amp;amp;index=14&amp;amp;list=FLX5MebKiIMwpcgIVC7t7GDQ&quot;&gt;phonautograph&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/files/CHI-2018-Core-Memory.pdf&quot;&gt;Rosner et al.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/parker-cold-dark-matter-an-exploded-view-t06949/story-cold-dark-matter&quot;&gt;Parker&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refrain from reducing technologies to only metaphors, experiences, or tech specs, or to only digital or analog processes; doing so acknowledges how talking about technology is entwined with using it, making it, and repairing it. All technical matters are also social and cultural matters. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/digital/&quot;&gt;McPherson&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/files/CHI-2018-Core-Memory.pdf&quot;&gt;Rosner et al.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/media/&quot;&gt;Nakamura&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember that data are produced, not given or captured; doing so emphasizes how this becomes that, or how data is structured, collected, and expressed for interpretation. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/essay/data/&quot;&gt;Greg and Nafus&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://anatomyof.ai/&quot;&gt;Crawford and Joler&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read any list like this one with a healthy dose of skepticism. Generosity of interpretation goes a long way, but gaps make bridges possible, and bias fuels advice. What’s missing from the list? How does it communicate? What motivates it? What does it assume? What does it want? How does it reflect a discipline or a moment in time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;practices&quot;&gt;Practices&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experiment across a spectrum of critical work; doing so values both distance and immersion. Try writing about technologies or composing critiques of them while also thinking with and through them. Researchers are not outside what they study, yet they should be aware of and reflect upon their influence and biases. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/files/CHI-2018-Core-Memory.pdf&quot;&gt;Rosner et al.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/sullivan.pdf&quot;&gt;Sullivan et al.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/essay/space/&quot;&gt;Morgan-Parmett&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whatjanesaw.org/&quot;&gt;Barchas&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask for permission before working with or circulating materials, and give credit where credit’s due; doing so privileges consent, licensing, attribution, and compensation in the research process. After all, the materials may not be yours to use or share. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uvic.ca/library/featured/copyright/fairdealing/index.php&quot;&gt;fair dealing&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alondranelson.com/books/afrofuturism&quot;&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timetravellertm.com/episodes/episode04.html&quot;&gt;Skawennati&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/sullivan.pdf&quot;&gt;Sullivan et al.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/leguin.pdf&quot;&gt;Le Guin&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conjecture with affordances; doing so demonstrates how design is relational. It happens between people, environments, and things; it’s not just a quality or property of objects. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/parker-cold-dark-matter-an-exploded-view-t06949/story-cold-dark-matter&quot;&gt;Parker&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whatjanesaw.org/&quot;&gt;Barchas&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/files/CHI-2018-Core-Memory.pdf&quot;&gt;Rosner et al.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Produce your own time and space through technologies; doing so may help you to project a world or speculate about one. Space and time are their own sort of media. They act upon us, but we can also compose with them. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alondranelson.com/books/afrofuturism&quot;&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timetravellertm.com/episodes/episode04.html&quot;&gt;Skawennati&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/essay/space/&quot;&gt;Morgan-Parmett&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/sullivan.pdf&quot;&gt;Sullivan et al.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Articulate your position on openness; doing so stresses how dissemination is only one step in the production process. For example, open data is useful, but people also need to know where it came from, how it was produced and with whose consent, and how to interpret it. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/digital/&quot;&gt;black box&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/essay/data/&quot;&gt;Gregg and Nafus&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://anatomyof.ai/&quot;&gt;Crawford and Joler&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/leguin.pdf&quot;&gt;Le Guin&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine what your project will help people to compile or “re-member”; doing so foregrounds how technologies are agents of memory and forgetting. Through automation and design, they assemble parts, compile components, and refresh files. Or, they keep things found for you. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/borges.pdf&quot;&gt;Borges&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/parker-cold-dark-matter-an-exploded-view-t06949/story-cold-dark-matter&quot;&gt;Parker&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c539cK58ees&quot;&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Address the ghosts; doing so helps to engage (instead of avoid or discount) the unknowns of your project, including its histories and futures. Even though we may not comprehend or apprehend how they work, technologies alone do not explain the past, solve pressing issues, or fix the future. They are components of social and cultural processes. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/files/CHI-2018-Core-Memory.pdf&quot;&gt;Rosner et al.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/sullivan.pdf&quot;&gt;Sullivan et al.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/leguin.pdf&quot;&gt;Le Guin&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask yourself where your project will be in ten, twenty, or even fifty years; doing so prompts attention to maintenance and obsolescence. If you want your project to stick around, then facilitate preservation and repair now rather than later. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QSHZ20MQfE&quot;&gt;Tennis for Two&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75UrxueiP-4&amp;amp;index=14&amp;amp;list=FLX5MebKiIMwpcgIVC7t7GDQ&quot;&gt;phonautograph&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://amodern.net/article/optophonic-reading/&quot;&gt;reading optophone&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where useful, value ephemerality and even magic as media; doing so may increase creativity and/or decrease pressure. Not all ideas, processes, and experiments need to be documented or tracked, and not everything about a project must be rationalized or demystified. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75UrxueiP-4&amp;amp;index=14&amp;amp;list=FLX5MebKiIMwpcgIVC7t7GDQ&quot;&gt;phonautograph&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/sullivan.pdf&quot;&gt;Sullivan et al.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whatjanesaw.org/&quot;&gt;Barchas&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nothing-to-hide-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Involve your audience; doing so helps to avoid reducing them to only users or consumers. It may also prompt some informative feedback and needed critique. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/files/CHI-2018-Core-Memory.pdf&quot;&gt;Rosner et al.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/sullivan.pdf&quot;&gt;Sullivan et al.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t reinvent the wheel, and be leery of over-investing in either novelty or failure; doing so may help to bypass the competitive tendencies and attention economics of design and development. Tweaking or customizing an existing technology may afford a lot; it may also reduce scope and feature creep. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QSHZ20MQfE&quot;&gt;Tennis for Two&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75UrxueiP-4&amp;amp;index=14&amp;amp;list=FLX5MebKiIMwpcgIVC7t7GDQ&quot;&gt;phonautograph&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/sullivan.pdf&quot;&gt;Sullivan et al.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a useless or disinterested version of your project; doing so may underscore the creative and critical dimensions of technology and society. After all, not all technologies must increase productivity or efficiency. Consider the roles of technologies in art, theory, and storytelling. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/parker-cold-dark-matter-an-exploded-view-t06949/story-cold-dark-matter&quot;&gt;Parker&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nothing-to-hide-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;prototyping-techniques&quot;&gt;Prototyping Techniques&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper&lt;/em&gt;: Use paper to make a simple version of your project. Changes, especially structural changes, may be easier when you’re working with index cards and pencils. (But sometimes software is indeed easier and/or better. Your call!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patent Search&lt;/em&gt;: Search patent databases for wholes and parts corresponding with your project. Many ideas are patented but never mass-manufactured. Also consider common components of patents: title, date (applied and granted), drawing (exploded view, perspective, and section), background (history and motivation), description (what it does), claims (dependent and independent), and name(s) of who filed it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2D/3D Translation&lt;/em&gt;: Use paper, plasticine, sticks, cardboard, or software to reconstruct a 2D drawing in 3D. Or use pen, paper, or software to represent a 3D object in 2D. The translation process should give you a sense of how perspective is biased (or limited) as well as how to relate with a given object in time and space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wireframing&lt;/em&gt;: Sketch your project’s form and interface without focusing much, if at all, on content. Wireframes provide a good sense of how people may interact with your project, and they don’t require any programming. They are also opportunities to talk about scope and feature creep (before the project is too far along).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploded-View Drawing&lt;/em&gt;: Express your project as a constellation of parts and relations. Exploded-view drawings have been used for centuries to demonstrate how things come together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emulation/Migration/Collection&lt;/em&gt;: Prototype how your project would be imitated or reproduced with software (emulation), how it would be treated as data or a repository of files (migration), and how it would be preserved as a system of hardware, software, wires, and whatnot (collection). These prototypes may provide a sense of your project’s near future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Old/New Media&lt;/em&gt;: Make old and new media versions of your project and then compare their affordances. Following Lev Manovich, new media are represented numerically, automated, variable, modular, and transcoded (both computational/technical and cultural).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Media Survey&lt;/em&gt;: Describe your project through a survey of media variously defined. Media may connect but also draw boundaries between this and that. Try describing your project as a window (through), portal (to), frame (around), link (between), container (in), address (at), negotiation (with), agent (for), and record (of). This list isn’t exhaustive, but it’s a start. It may help to articulate a language for your project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Index/Icon/Symbol&lt;/em&gt;: Render your project as an index (such as data, which points to something), an icon (such as an image that represents an app on your phone), and symbols (such as a tagline of words that produce meaning for people). This approach underscores how your project is not only designed but also communicated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reverse-Engineering&lt;/em&gt;: Find a thing resembling your project, take it apart, trace the parts and their histories, and put the thing back together. Document the process and reflect on how it pertains to technology as congealed labour. (You can also have someone else reverse-engineer your project.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personas&lt;/em&gt;: Create fictional characters to better understand a past or future scenario for your project. Use the personas to address how such representations are reductive and problematic yet quite common in marketing. You can also use personas to highlight how and why you cannot inhabit the past.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Force Map&lt;/em&gt;: Integrate your personas into a static illustration with a setting (time and place), concerns (expressed by the personas), media (what mediates the concerns and relations between personas), and relations (lines connecting personas and concerns). This map should illustrate your project as a social and material process. It should also reveal what you don’t (yet) know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use Story&lt;/em&gt;: Animate your personas and force map by storyboarding a context of use for your project. Try 3-6 panels of content, which may resemble a comic book or graphic novel. Perform and even video-record the storyboard, if you wish. Storyboarding situates otherwise abstract representations (such as exploded-view drawings) and foregrounds the importance of embodied experiences and social relations to project design and development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playtest or Workshop&lt;/em&gt;: Circulate your project for feedback. Give groups specific problems or issues on which to focus. Later, conduct another workshop, where you don’t intervene or guide the participants; be a fly on the wall, observe them interacting with your project, and take notes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Datification&lt;/em&gt;: Prototype your project with data in mind. Cook up a data model (entities, attributes for each entity, and relations between entities), some sample data, and an example of use. For whom is the data produced? By whom? How? Under what assumptions? How transparent is the process? How do people consent to and participate in it? Such prototypes should prompt considerations of control, surveillance, play (or gamification), and labour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dystopia/Utopia&lt;/em&gt;: Integrate your datification into two dramatically different scenarios: one where the results are ostensibly positive, and one where the results are ostensibly negative. Articulate why you think the results are positive and negative, and also why technology is even necessary to achieve them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design Brief&lt;/em&gt;: Compose a design brief for your prototype. Include your project’s social &lt;em&gt;aim&lt;/em&gt; (a specific social issue supported by peer-reviewed research), intended &lt;em&gt;audience&lt;/em&gt; (a specific group for whom your project is designed), &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt; (a particular place or situation), core &lt;em&gt;parts&lt;/em&gt; (the primary ingredients of your prototype), &lt;em&gt;aesthetics&lt;/em&gt; (affordances, or how your prototype engages people), &lt;em&gt;responsibilities&lt;/em&gt; (what the project may change or affect, who will be responsible for those changes, and how), and &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; (what the project won’t or doesn’t do). Provide example materials, too, such as illustrations, wireframes, photographs, code, video, and/or tactile prototypes. Design briefs are often written by firms and oriented toward clients or customers, but this version is intended to engage the course material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Types of Prototypes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This document (also available in &lt;a href=&quot;../archive/resources/typesOfPrototypes.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) is intended as a resource for people who are curious about how prototyping or “remaking” source materials intersects with the praxis of literary and textual criticism. It lists types of prototypes and explains what they help us to better understand. Next, it describes how prototyping is, or may be, a form of criticism. And finally, it explains how prototypes “address us.” I’ve used the language of “source materials,” but perhaps you prefer “texts” or the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Types of prototypes (not exhaustive), and why you might try them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imitation&lt;/em&gt; (labour of source material): to better understand the composition of source material by learning the techniques involved in its production&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgery&lt;/em&gt; (economy of source material): to better understand the public perception and/or value of source material by learning the techniques involved in its production, but with intent to either deceive or reveal deception&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario&lt;/em&gt; (interaction with source material): to better understand how people may ultimately interpret source material by situating it in contexts of use and then observing those uses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story&lt;/em&gt; (performance of source material): to better understand how source material gains cultural traction or builds identity by treating it as a script and performing it on or off record&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterfactual&lt;/em&gt; (norms or conditions of source material): to better understand the biases of source material (or common interpretations of it) by constructing “what-if” alternatives to specific aspects of its history, content, or composition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model&lt;/em&gt; (logic or conventions of source material): to better understand the mode, form, genre, scale, or design of source material by rendering it as an abstraction, using it to alter other source materials (or aspects of itself), and determining why the changes are interesting (if at all)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wish&lt;/em&gt; (ideology of source material): to better understand the worldviews, belief systems, or desires of source material by increasing/decreasing their frequency, reversing them, or otherwise manipulating them and then determining why the changes are interesting (if at all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototyping may be considered a form of criticism that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performs a method or physically &lt;em&gt;manifests a way of reading&lt;/em&gt; through techniques such as imitation, alteration, scripting, repetition, simulation, recontextualization, modelling, counterfactuals, ruination, and trial-and-error testing, to name a few.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is interpreted or assessed based on its &lt;em&gt;effectiveness as an experiment&lt;/em&gt;, or how persuasively it changes or isolates the systems through which materials and contexts afford meaning. Such systems may include matters of perception (e.g., how materials are seen or engaged), semantics (e.g., how signifiers relate and produce meaning), aesthetics (e.g., how materials are arranged and composed), politics (e.g., how materials enable or are embedded in ideologies), history (e.g., how materials are anchored in time and space but also move across them), matter (e.g., the stuff of which materials are made), and want or need (e.g., wishes, desires, uses, and applications).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expresses a form or model, which foregrounds use and &lt;em&gt;prompts specific actions&lt;/em&gt;. Such actions may include writing in a margin or blank space, entering data, replying to a message, fixing a bug, following steps, signing, clicking, copying, pasting, deleting, scanning, redacting, searching, tagging, spamming, non-communication (e.g., in the case of frustration, silence, or confusion), or simply listening, watching, or reading. The consequences of these actions are not always predictable. In fact, the most persuasive prototypes foster surprise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Articulates language and meaning with matter. While prototypes are conceptual, they demonstrate (as opposed to re-present) how concepts &lt;em&gt;work through materials&lt;/em&gt; and settings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suggests or conjectures something instead of proving it. That is, a prototype is a &lt;em&gt;situation for interpretation&lt;/em&gt;, not a standalone object. Meaning is an effect of experimentation, not an ingredient of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Imagines a solution or &lt;em&gt;scenario&lt;/em&gt; to examine the results. Such scenarios may include improving features of source material, stewarding it into the present, remediating it, remaking it, repairing it, or (to demonstrate why it was persuasive in the first place) ruining it. Any of these practices may experiment with alternate histories, probable futures, adjacent possibilities, or absences in the archive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Often uses &lt;em&gt;ephemerality as a medium&lt;/em&gt;. That is, it tends to be more interested in what escapes than what persists. Here, we may consider how interactions, interfaces, performances, rhythms, impressions, feelings, and affects escape the record or are difficult to “capture” with technologies. Put this way, loss is not necessarily an anxiety or emphasis. Change becomes the most interesting or suggestive element of creativity and criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototyping also asks how source materials address us (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/1771&quot;&gt;Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials function as public documents, intended for passersby. Here, negative space, lines, typefaces, and font sizes are especially important (e.g., graphic design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants your attention&lt;/em&gt;. It is charged. It is read from a distance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials become symbols, intended for extended observation. Here, the form or “face” across components is key (e.g., topography). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to escape reality&lt;/em&gt;. It welds feeling with arrangement, against the reduction of signs to mere vehicles for meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials manifest ways of reading, intended for familiarization or defamiliarization. Here, orientation, embodiment, and eye movement are most significant (e.g., interface design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to afford certain readings&lt;/em&gt;. It influences or even structures vision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials create relations with other materials, intended for the production or analysis of patterns. Here, juxtaposition and reference are central (e.g., interaction design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be an index&lt;/em&gt;, with readers traversing across (or toggling between) it and something else. It connects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are proof, intended as evidence. Here, the truth claims are emphasized (e.g., forensics). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be a record&lt;/em&gt;. It is like a photograph or signature. It points or demonstrates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are objects or commodities, intended for collection and exhibition. Here, the value, availability, and economy of materials are privileged (e.g., book arts). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be displayed&lt;/em&gt;. People travel to witness the original. Something about it cannot be copied.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are scans, intended primarily for access on screen. Here, recognition, formats, and relations between witnesses, editions, originals, and copies are the focus (e.g., versioning). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be found or archived&lt;/em&gt;. It is its legibility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are edges, intended to produce boundaries. Here, page size, margins, paper, screens, and canvases matter (e.g., layout design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to frame language and reading&lt;/em&gt;. It demarcates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are windows or portals, intended for transparency. Here, clarity is everything (e.g., instrumental design). The material &lt;em&gt;gives people want they want or expect&lt;/em&gt;. It is a vehicle for exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are mirrors, intended for reflection or re-presentation. Here, a lack of ornament, a use of familiar features, and an insistence on accuracy of perspective are significant (e.g., isomorphic design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to express the world precisely and/or prompt awareness&lt;/em&gt; (or social- or self-awareness). It hails.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are tactile, intended for handling and touching. Here, texture is paramount (e.g., materials design). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be tangible&lt;/em&gt;, or it does not want to be behind glass or screen. It exposes the limits of vision and ocularcentrism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are processes, intended to resist alienation or abstraction. Here, composition, traces of interaction, gradual change, and the time spent making, reproducing, preserving, and disposing are most important (e.g., labour studies). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be a verb&lt;/em&gt;. It is mutable. It decays, rots, morphs, grows. It is also linked to various “invisible” contributors and acts of production.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are dogma, intended for followers. Here, lists, point form, and order are foregrounded (e.g., litany). The material &lt;em&gt;wants to be copied&lt;/em&gt;, distributed, consulted, and observed. It directs or guides.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source materials are policy or law, intended for nations, citizens, or employees. Here, an absence of aesthetics, a lack of variation, or an assertion of consistency is crucial (e.g., protocol). The material does not want to be an image. It &lt;em&gt;wants to be code or procedure&lt;/em&gt;, with a standard. It is executable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Paper Computers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Paper Computers” was a grad seminar (Fall 2018) about developing procedural literacy through tabletop game design. Students prototyped their own games and game manuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I borrowed the term, “paper computers,” from Matthew Kirschenbaum to foreground not only low-tech prototyping but also histories of paper as a medium for storage, processing, and play. We dedicated most of our seminar time to speculative design, asking “what if?” and experimenting with games as procedural systems. We attended to the past in the process by drawing upon materials—from books and games to zines and experimental media—available in UVic Special Collections. I also invited people from the worlds of design and criticism to join us as guest speakers. Hearing from these speakers and talking with them was a highlight of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official description of “Paper Computers” is below, together with links to the course website, my notes, and other related resources. The notes include keywords in games and design as well as suggestions for prototyping and a list of relevant games and readings. I also wrote a reflection (titled, “Tabletop Inquiry”) on the course, produced a handout for local high school students, and gave a talk at UVic in 2019 on the pedagogy of “Paper Computers.” The slides for that talk include photographs of some games prototyped by students in the seminar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who participated in “Paper Computers” for an absolutely wonderful course and to Avery Alder, Nina Belojevic, Whitney “Strix” Beltrán, Anne Burdick, Emily Care Boss, Alexander Galloway, Amy Hildreth Chen, Isaac Childres, Derek Hansen, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Kari Kraus, Michael Lines, Shaun Macpherson, Renee M. Shelby, Nikki Valens, and Lara Wilson for joining us as guest speakers and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Seminar&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
Tabletop games are “paper computers,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academia.edu/16198903/War_Stories_Board_Wargames_and_Vast_Procedural_Narratives&quot;&gt;Matthew Kirschenbaum&lt;/a&gt;. They are centuries old. They are designed. They enact systems of rules and procedures. And, most important, you don’t have to charge or program them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seminar follows that low-tech disposition. We’ll survey the history of paper computers and their entanglements with literature. Then you’ll select a cultural movement or -ism (between 1870 and 1970) and use it to prototype your own tabletop game. We’ll discuss the material dynamics that bridge aesthetics with mechanics, including how games routinely rehearse legacies of colonialism and capital accumulation. What alternatives exist, and how are they made? We’ll play some games as we go, and read a smidgen of media theory and fiction, too. From week to week, we’ll ground it all in design practices, such as bookmaking, 3D modelling, fabricating, and playtesting. Various guest speakers will join us. By the end, you should develop a palpable sense of how this becomes that with a computer, but without running culture in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding: none. Educational games: none. Meeples: likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aims of the Seminar&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
For you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examine the entanglements of game studies with literary studies through A-D-M and M-D-A frameworks that foreground the material dynamics (“D”) between aesthetics (“A”) and mechanics (“M”).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand digital studies as a centuries-old design practice and approach it through “low-tech” techniques anchored in gaming, prototyping, and playtesting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn how speculative design and game prototyping apply to digital project development, with particular attention to labour, conjecture, and negotiation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prototype an offline tabletop game informed by the politics and aesthetics of an -ism and document the prototyping process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share and test your tabletop game with people in and beyond this seminar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate (via a presentation and in writing) the relevance of your game prototype to literary and digital studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Media Studies + DH</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt; (2018) introduces readers to the theory and practice of engaging media through new media. I edited the book to be neither a textbook nor a collection of debates. It instead provides snapshots of how media are variously made and interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Companion’s 52 chapters address issues such as moving beyond text as a medium in the humanities, foregrounding the importance of collaboration and laboratories outside the sciences, attending to cultural criticism and social justice in the design and development of technologies, and expanding what “intervention” and “research contribution” mean in scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book’s official description, its table of contents, a glossary of media projects mentioned in it, and abstracts for all 52 chapters are below. The book is available for purchase in paperback, hardback, and ebook formats, and 38 of the chapters are open access. Look for “open access” links after chapter titles listed on this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the Companion’s contributors, who engaged in dialogue with me for four years and were (and remain) a positive force for change. Danielle Morgan produced the cover image for the Companion. Nadia Timperio worked with me to prepare the Companion for publication, and Allison Murphy indexed it with me. Students in &lt;a href=&quot;/prototypingtexts/&quot;&gt;English 508&lt;/a&gt; at UVic provided valuable feedback on several chapters, and Steven E. Jones, Willard McCarty, Stuart Moulthrop, and Melissa Terras offered insightful responses to the Companion during the proposal stage. Endless thanks to Nina Belejovic, Tiffany Chan, Cathy Davidson, Katherine Goertz, Julie Klein, Shaun Macpherson, Tara McPherson, Danielle Morgan, and Kathy Woodward for their advice, support, and perspective early in the process. Of course, the Companion would not have been possible without the teams at Routledge and Florence Production, including Mia Moran, Erica Wetter, Emma Sudderick, and Jessica Bithrey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;
Published with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Companion-to-Media-Studies-and-Digital-Humanities/Sayers/p/book/9781138844308&quot;&gt;Routledge&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 | 52 chapters (38 open access) | 564 pages including the index&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt;: introduction, &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/books/msdhIntroduction2018.pdf&quot;&gt;“Studying Media through New Media”&lt;/a&gt; (PDF); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/books/msdhToc2018.pdf&quot;&gt;table of contents&lt;/a&gt; (PDF); &lt;a href=&quot;/glossary/&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; of media projects (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jentery/routledgeCompanionMSDH&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; of Markdown files (GitHub); &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Companion-to-Media-Studies-and-Digital-Humanities/Sayers/p/book/9781138844308&quot;&gt;publisher’s page&lt;/a&gt; (HTML)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although media studies and digital humanities are established fields, their overlaps have not been examined in depth. This comprehensive collection fills that gap, giving readers a critical guide to understanding the array of methodologies and projects operating at the intersections of media, culture, and practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Companion is organized into five sections: 1) &lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;Access, Praxis, Justice&lt;/a&gt;; 2) &lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;Design, Interface, Interaction&lt;/a&gt;; 3) &lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;Mediation, Method, Materiality&lt;/a&gt;; 4) &lt;a href=&quot;#4&quot;&gt;Remediation, Data, Memory&lt;/a&gt;; and 5) &lt;a href=&quot;#5&quot;&gt;Making, Programming, Hacking&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/books/msdhIntroduction2018.pdf&quot;&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt;, and with Nadia Timperio I produced a &lt;a href=&quot;/glossary/&quot;&gt;glossary of media projects&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/books/msdhToc2018.pdf&quot;&gt;table of contents&lt;/a&gt;, with titles and authors for all 52 chapters. The chapter abstracts are below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Access, Praxis, Justice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This section highlights social justice issues that permeate the entirety of the Companion. It also demonstrates how social justice work is enacted through new media as a form of praxis, in part by expanding the definition of “access” through an emphasis on participation, but also by sharing various modes of activism involving new media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 1. “Theory/Practice: Lessons Learned from Feminist Film Studies,” by Tara McPherson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter investigates possible relationships of theory to practice within digital humanities and media studies and also calls for a more politically engaged approach to both fields. It seeks to move beyond the binary framing of the DH slogan, “less yack, more hack,” by arguing for a more integrative and dialectical melding of making and critique. In particular, the piece turns to feminist film studies of the late 1970s to examine an earlier moment in media studies that sought to integrate media production, distribution, theory, and pedagogy toward expressly political ends. In conversation with contemporary feminist scholarship in new materialisms and digital media studies, it argues that practices of making can and should enrich our theoretical and discursive endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 2. “#cut/paste+bleed: Entangling Feminist Affect, Action, and Production On and Offline,” by Alexandra Juhasz&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academicworks.cuny.edu/bc_pubs/163/&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter considers one of the author’s media-critical and -situated projects, ev-ent-anglement, as a lab where doing and thinking in community and within the sites or technologies under consideration are the scholarship. In such scholarly work, the doing and the process are the product, and what is built towards those ends can also be shared and/or evaluated in other contexts and for different communities. This allocating and re-allocating of process in and as the product is modeled in the essay itself, albeit within yet another technology: the paper-bound scholarly anthology. The chapter places ev-ent-anglement into the author’s larger scholarly project that engages, critically, with social media networks from inside them; shares lessons learned about practice-based research; and concludes with why such methods (as much as findings) might matter. She explains her thinking and doing, and the histories and theories that motivated this critical internet experiment where “our object was our self and ourselves and then these objects got out of hand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 3. “Analog Girls in Digital Worlds: Dismantling Binaries for Digital Humanists Who Research Social Media,” by Moya Bailey&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:cj82rc48t&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only academics have the skills and means to integrate digital tools and humanistic inquiry. We argue that these distinctions are both real and imagined and as such need to be examined closely to determine the intricate and multilayered dynamics of each space. We make two main arguments in this chapter: the digital world and the ivory tower are powerful tools for circulating ideas and creating access to our communities, and the power that the digital and academic worlds wield needs to be challenged, both from the inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 4. “(Cyber)Ethnographies of Contact, Dialogue, Friction: Connecting, Building, Placing, and Doing ‘Data,’” by Radhika Gajjala, Erika M. Behrmann, and Jeanette Dillon&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academia.edu/39818832/_Cyber_Ethnographies_of_Contact_Dialogue_Friction_Connecting_Building_Placing_and_Doing_Data_&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter takes a look at questions of methods in the age of big data while asking questions about epistemic considerations and digital ontologies. The three co-authors discuss these issues in the context of cyberethnography and of building and doing data by using each of their research projects as points of entry. They write about global connections and frictions in three related contexts where millennials are engaged in philanthropy. Behrmann draws on an examination of the &lt;em&gt;Half the Sky&lt;/em&gt; movement, Dillon draws on her study of college students engaged in social entrepreneurial projects, and Gajjala examines this intersection through a look at how do-it-yourself (DIY) prosumerism intersects with online microfinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 5. “Of, By, and For the Internet: New Media Studies and Public Scholarship,” by Aimée Morrison&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/13374&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter proposes we must actively work to craft a new media studies of, by, and for the internet, one that must seek to transform rather than simply disrupt both scholarship and the broader social landscape, or our online scholarly practices will certainly reinscribe existing hierarchies and inequities. New media studies, of, by, and for the internet is not the abstract and utopian dream for perfect communication envisioned in the early 1990s, suited to more idealistic aims of seamless transmission of information. It is about whose speech is suppressed, by what means, and how this suppression can be countered. It is about the care work entailed in seeking social change, accounting for the toll this care work exacts, and sharing that load more equitably by extending material and emotional supports to those from whom this work demands the highest personal costs. I consider viral academic speech as offering the opportunity to develop and sustain new modes of “public/scholarship,” beginning by examining a viral academic speech event that happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 6. “Women Who Rock: Making Scenes, Building Communities (Convivencia and Archivista Praxis for a Digital Era),” by Michelle Habell-Pallán, Sonnet Retman, Angelica Macklin, and Monica De La Torre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women Who Rock: Making Scenes, Building Communities (WWR) brings together scholars, musicians, media-makers, performers, artists, and activists to explore the role of women and popular music in the creation of cultural scenes that anchor social justice movements in the Amerícas and beyond. Our vision of digital humanities and media production is process-driven. Grounded in women-of-color feminist theorizing, WWR reshapes conventional understandings of music and cultural production by initiating decolonial methods of research, archiving, teaching, and community / scholarly collaboration. At WWR’s center is an oral history archive that ties together an annual community engagement unconference and film festival, and project-based graduate and undergraduate coursework. This chapter explores our experiences of “doing” digital humanities together through a method of convivencia and archivista praxis to develop a networked, digital archive hosted by the University of Washington Libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 7. “Decolonizing Digital Humanities in Theory and Practice,” by Roopika Risam&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcommons.salemstate.edu/english_facpub/7/&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between digital humanities and decolonization has become a popular one, representing a range of interventions. These include decolonizing digital archives, addressing representation in digital knowledge production, and using digital media to create spaces for voices that go unheard in dominant narratives of literature, history, and culture. This chapter examines the complex politics of decolonization in digital humanities. It begins by considering how discourses of decolonization have been deployed in the context of digital humanities and situating them in postcolonial theory and science and technology studies. The chapter then explores digital humanities projects that participate in decolonizing knowledge production. In doing so, it makes the case for culturally located approaches to digital humanities that resist reinscribing the politics of colonialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 8. “Interactive Narratives: Addressing Social and Political Trauma through New Media,” by Isabel Cristina Restrepo Acevedo&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bibliotecadigital.udea.edu.co/dspace/handle/10495/11228&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter addresses the development of collective and unofficial dialogic spaces through new media as a way to engage social and political trauma and also facilitate mobilization towards healing and change. Specifically, it examines the creation of interactive narratives that go beyond words or written expression by integrating audience participation (physically and mentally) with different levels of impact. As a case study, it focuses on interactive narratives that use remote sensing technologies to track audience members’ bodies and actions during art installations about the traumatic social and political circumstances surrounding people in Colombia, Argentina, and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 9. “Wear and Care: Feminisms at a Long Maker Table,” by Jacque Wernimont and Elizabeth Losh&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarworks.wm.edu/asbookchapters/5/&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of popularity in hacker/makerspaces has come an old reproduction of inequality at the sites of innovation and education in which women, people of color, middle-aged and elderly citizens, queer and genderqueer people, and people with disabilities are affectively and/or economically excluded. This chapter leverages pedagogical case studies, including our summer course, Feminist Digital Humanities: Theoretical, Social, and Material Engagements around Making and Breaking Computational Media, to sketch out a vision of a “long maker table” that draws on the feminist performance art tradition to break into and break open makerspaces that have been traditionally coded as white, affluent, masculine spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 10. “A Glitch in the Tower: Academia, Disability, and Digital Humanities,” by Elizabeth Ellcessor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disability poses a challenge to academic uses of digital media technologies. It is a “glitch,” a moment in which things do not work as they should, as is often the case when digital media are inaccessible to disabled people. This chapter begins with that “glitch,” asking how it might cause us to reflect on the ways in which technological design privileges and excludes different people. Using literature on disability and digital media and drawing on universal design for learning, the chapter proposes three avenues by which digital humanities may promote inclusive academic environments: humanistic analysis, critically engaged praxis, and direct advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 11. “Games Studies for Great Justice,” by Amanda Phillips&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/1051500&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the age of GamerGate, the “social justice warrior” has become a polarizing figure in gaming culture: a hero to some (who might prefer job classes like wizard or rogue instead), but an emblem of all that is wrong with political correctness to others. Videogames may seem a trivial object for those concerned with something so grand as cultural equity, but they are an increasingly important component of the media landscapes that shape the world around us. There are many disciplinary strategies for seeking justice, and the popular turmoil around videogames and social justice demands more attention and resources. This chapter offers five concrete suggestions for game studies academics to leverage their work for the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 12. “Self-Determination in Indigenous Games,” by Elizabeth LaPensée&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.academia.edu/34857256/_Self-Determined_Indigenous_Games._Routledge_Companion_to_Media_Studies_and_Digital_Humanities._Ed._Jentery_Sayers._Abingdon_Routledge_2018._128-137&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games are a powerful medium for expression, with their unique layering of play, story, art, and audio brought about through design and code. Self-determined Indigenous games could be considered what Anishinaabe writer, Gerald Vizenor, refers to as survivance – survival, endurance, and resistance. The award-winning platformer, Never Alone (developed for consoles and PCs by the Cook Inlet Tribal Council in collaboration with ally game company, E-Line Media), weaves a historical-traditional story into gameplay with Iñupiaq art, language, and teachings. The mobile game, Invaders (with art by Steven Paul Judd inspired by the classic arcade game, Space Invaders), represents colonization as an 8-bit alien invasion. Blood Quantum, a Real Time Strategy game (by Renee Nejo), which uses non-human droplet characters battling over communities, represents a statement about how blood quantum policies contribute to ongoing colonization. Looking at these games exemplifies the ways in which Indigenous culture and experiences bring about unique game design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. Design, Interface, Interaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Design, interfaces, and interaction are too often considered additive, as if they are features layered over code just before release. Against such tendencies, this section exhibits the centrality of design to critical and creative inquiry with media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 13. “Making Meaning, Making Culture: How to Think about Technology and Cultural Reproduction,” by Anne Balsamo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas many digital humanities projects focus on the creation of new applications and platforms, less frequently will these projects take into account the “infrastructuring” of cultural meanings. This chapter considers the challenge for digital humanities projects to manifest critical insights about the relationship between culture and technology. I promote a reproductive theory of technology as a framework for understanding the cultural implications of designing digital applications. This approach asserts that such projects must be considered not merely as technological applications, but rather as complex socio-techno-cultural assemblages that both replicate and reconfigure cultural understandings. To illustrate how these theoretical insights manifested in a specific project, I describe an interactive application called &lt;em&gt;AIDS Quilt Touch&lt;/em&gt; that enables people to view, search, and annotate digital images of the AIDS Memorial Quilt. Designed by a distributed team of digital humanists, creative technologists, and public artists, the project unfolded as a hybrid media system focused on engaging members of the public in learning about an important work of cultural heritage. This chapter reflects on the &lt;em&gt;AIDS Quilt Touch&lt;/em&gt; design process to identify how questions of culture eclipsed questions of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 14. “Contemporary and Future Spaces for Media Studies and Digital Humanities,” by Patrik Svensson&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://patriksv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/14svenssonPatrik.pdf&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter looks at space as an institutional, critical, and creative category for media studies and digital humanities. Following a background section on space and knowledge production, a hypothetical merger between a digital humanities initiative and a media studies department explores some of the tensions and possibilities at play. A basic issue discussed throughout the chapter is the entanglement of conceptual foundations (goals and intentions) and material manifestations (physical and digital structures). This entanglement is discussed through a framework based on the notions of intellectual middleware and design principles. The final section looks at the question of whether there can be a shared vision of the two fields in question, including whether we might consider manifesting such a vision through shared space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 15. “Finding Fault Lines: An Approach to Speculative Design,” by Kari Kraus&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XD2AnQVB4bZUoT9IzlyueoDe02RmqvtU/view&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter proposes a classification system of the various subjunctive practices that unify otherwise disparate artists, inventors, historians, conservators, and others whose work involves imagining or inferring the unknown. The “speculative design” of my title refers to the output or end products of all eleven categories in the classification system. Thus, for example, a conjecturally restored painting, a reconstructed text, and a scientific simulation of a flu pandemic are all works of speculative design that fall under the respective categories of “restoration,” “conjectural criticism,” and “scientific prediction.” Drawing on cognitive scientist Ruth Byrne’s notion of “fault lines in reality,” I argue that the fractures and cracks – both literal and conceptual – in everyday objects and events yield the fragments that form the raw material of speculative design. I illustrate the method of fault lines and various types of subjunctive practice with the help of the Whereabouts Clock, a make-believe technology found in the Harry Potter universe that has crossed over to the real world as a hybrid, physical-digital object. The chapter closes with a set of workshop activities informed by the subjunctive practices, including the category of “speculative wear.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 16. “Game Mechanics, Experience Design, and Affective Play,” by Patrick Jagoda and Peter McDonald&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/250&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explores games as a major object of study in both new media theory and practice. Two primary critical approaches, organized around procedure and play, have dominated game studies in the early 2000s. This essay advocates a middle ground through a form of experience design that foregrounds the ways a game affects players and how players can be affected by it: experientially, kinesthetically, and ideologically. The main site for this elaboration of affect is game mechanics. A focus on mechanics helps us be attentive to the range of possible play experiences, including gradations and shadings of various named emotions and non-conscious intensities. A brief theoretical overview of major competing contemporary perspectives in game studies opens up into a consideration for using a practice-based research method to design learning-oriented and serious games in new media studies. The chapter draws from close readings of existing digital and analog games, as well as techniques developed through the creative process in the Game Changer Chicago Design Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 17. “Critical Play and Responsible Design,” by Mary Flanagan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is great interest in how games promote pro-social values, due to the impact other media forms have had toward a more progressive society. In light of the financial and cultural sway of games, designing and playing critically is an indispensable approach in the domain of applied media studies research and for engaging the social and cultural dimensions of digital games. Critical Play is a useful concept to media studies and digital humanities, for it interjects notions of critical thinking and values into both the examination of games and the creation of playful artifacts. Games can operate as attitude shifters, as platforms for exploring subjectivity, and as sites for community engagement and collective visioning. How games function as their own art form – and not mere delivery mechanisms or media – is essential to understanding the role they play in criticality and social impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 18. “A Call to Action: Embodied Thinking and Human-Computer Interaction Design,” by Jessica Rajko&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/206411/content/Rajko_ACallToAction.pdf&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter is not a guide to embodied thinking, but rather a critical call to action. It highlights the deep history of embodied practice within the fields of dance and somatics and outlines the value of embodied thinking within human-computer interaction (HCI) design. While there are strong parallels between the use of the term “embodiment” in both somatic (self-reflective) practices and the empirical (observational) practices most commonly cited in HCI design theory, the fundamental differences in methodology lead to striking differences in how embodiment is understood and used as a means of thinking. This chapter explores some of the pitfalls of only considering embodiment within the context of observation and articulates the potential for more thoughtful and ethical wearable technology (WT) design through somatic and dance-based practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 19. “Wearable Interfaces, Networked Bodies, and Feminist Sleeper Agents,” by Kim A. Brillante Knight&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:20123/&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, I argue that one must account for the materiality of the body in the wearable interface. The wearable interface is a process enacted within an assemblage of dress-body-technology, with the potential to construct a radical cyborg subject. However, the current most ubiquitous form of wearable technology, the fitness tracker, fails to fulfill the cyborg’s promise of kinship and affinity. Instead, it facilitates the myth of self-reliant neoliberal subjectivity. I examine alternative landscapes in which wearables might contribute to counterpublic formation through arts and design, as well as feminist epistemologies and critical making in the university classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 20. “Deep Mapping: Space, Place, and Narrative as Urban Interface,” by Maureen Engel&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/2eac02c2-7cb3-419a-96ad-f960a74b72c9&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep mapping is an emergent scholarly practice that makes arguments spatially, frequently in the form of a map. This chapter puts deep mapping practices into an historical context with geography and cartography to show how practitioners have taken theoretical liberties with maps and geographic information systems (GIS) by challenging their claims to indexicality and objectivity. First, the chapter outlines theoretical interventions of the last 30 years that have challenged our commonplace ideas of space and place. It then examines three specific examples of deep mapping projects: The Edmonton Pipelines Project, a research cell at the University of Alberta; The London Streetmuseum app, a locative media application that annotates contemporary London with historical images and narratives; and HyperCities, a UCLA-based project and platform that allows scholars to build deep maps without having to acquire prohibitive technological skills. Bringing these three projects together shows the different paths and practices that deep mapping can take, self-consciously producing spatial arguments as situated knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 21. “Smart Things, Smart Subjects: How the ‘Internet of Things’ Enacts Pervasive Media,” by Beth Coleman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known variously as “smart” technologies, ambient intelligence, and social machines, Internet of Things (IoT) technology extends our reach across networked information (internet and mobile computing) into the material world. There are objects such as “smart” cars that drive themselves and “smart” tiles that tell us where our dumb objects, such as keys and bikes, are hiding. This chapter asks, “What is the place of the human actor in this network of interactions and automated exchanges?” If there is an emergent smart thing, is there also a corollary smart subject?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. Mediation, Method, Materiality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of treating media as “containers” that transmit content, this section of the Companion attends to various forms of mediation, affect, and materiality important to humanities research. Many of the authors also translate mediation into a method for inquiry. Here, mediation is not something delegated to instruments or overwritten by research techniques; it is what prompts interesting questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 22. “Approaching Sound,” by Tara Rodgers&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.analogtara.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/Rodgers-2018-Approaching-Sound.pdf&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound is a material and cultural phenomenon that embodies and catalyzes a diffuse set of relations. It functions as both a carrier of cultural knowledge and an expressive medium modulated by individual and collaborative creativity. It is sound’s relational aspects, and its dynamic modes of connecting and transecting individual elements and complex wholes, that make it resoundingly political. This chapter presents sound definitions, histories, and methods by examining soundmakers’ work alongside key concepts in cultural studies of music and sound, proposing a range of possibilities for approaching sound creatively and critically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 23. “Algorhythmics: A Diffractive Approach for Understanding Computation,” by Shintaro Miyazaki&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://irf.fhnw.ch/bitstream/handle/11654/26375/23miyazakiShintaro.pdf?sequence=1&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter offers an alternative approach to computation, with an emphasis on our senses (especially hearing) and the notion of algorhythmics, a neologism combining algorithm with rhythm. As a method, algorhythmics builds on Karen Barad’s approach to diffraction and extends media theory through feminist thinking by prompting researchers to study media through other media. Via two examples, the chapter demonstrates how a sensitivity towards time-based processes, especially the rhythms of digital storage, transmission, and processing, might be useful for a critical understanding of digital cultures. It also provides some arguments for algorhythmics as a crucial method within digital humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 24. “Software Studies Methods,” by Matthew Fuller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides a short overview of some of the conceptual and practical methods developed in the interdisciplinary field of software studies. After assessing some of the contexts in which software studies arose, it briefly reviews technical, cultural, theoretical, and artistic means of understanding the nature of computational structures and processes and their role in the constitution of contemporary forms of life. It also addresses some of the controversies, points of differentiation, and critical articulations in the field as well as examples of key methodological tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 25. “Physical Computing, Embodied Practice,” by Nina Belojevic and Shaun Macpherson&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ninabelojevic.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/25belojevicninamacphersonshaun.pdf&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical computing is broadly defined as the practice of combining hardware design with computer programming to create networked, interactive devices and environments. Most often associated with increasingly popular “maker cultures,” it constructs interfaces between computers and bodies beyond the screen, mouse, and keyboard, which are most often associated with human-computer interaction (HCI). Since physical computing is an inherently embodied practice, it encourages practitioners to apply a reciprocal methodology whereby hands-on exploration is combined with the development of new discourses. This chapter explores physical computing and its potential application in critical studies of media, technology, and other scholarly inquiries via a brief introduction to the histories, practices, and effects that computers have on culture, society, and the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 26. “Turning Practice Inside Out: Digital Humanities and the Eversion,” by Steven E. Jones&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://works.bepress.com/steven-jones/58/&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What William Gibson called the “eversion of cyberspace” – its turning inside out – provides a context for understanding the emergence of the new digital humanities (DH) around 2004-2008. Digital humanities practice has both contributed and responded to the eversion. What was once understood as a transcendent virtual reality is now experienced as a ubiquitous grid of data that we move through and interact with every day, a new perspective that calls on DH practice to engage the social, locative, embodied, and object-oriented nature of our experience in the networked world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 27. “Conjunctive and Disjunctive Networks: Affects, Technics, and Arts in the Experience of Relation,” by Anna Munster&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:51593/binede59fa8-4fa3-40b0-8cb2-658d764e5270?view=true&amp;amp;xy=01&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sociotechnical assemblages, networks are both singular and nonlocalized. They are constituted by standardized communicative protocols that operate across open architectures that make them available to artistic intervention, corporate takeover, and nonpartisan political ends. Yet the ways in which networks experience, as well as human experience in and of networks, must be thought in close proximity to questions of affect. For networks are not simply organizational forms or maps of contemporary life. They involve processes of joining with and disjoining from others, not to mention technical elements and their operations. This chapter takes affect, technics, and their relations as primary in the experience of online networked life and looks to the ways in which early online, artistic cultures experimented with these relations. My engagement with the critical networked culture of the late 1980s and early 1990s was formative in the development of my current approach to thinking through these relations as an “aesthesia” of networks. This concept approaches the experience of networks through technical, affective, human, and nonhuman elements. It sees the transitions and breaks in their relations as critical for an understanding of contemporary media and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 28. “From ‘Live’ to Real Time: On Future Television Studies,” by Mark J. Williams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter surveys critical constructs and methodological differences within television studies as they relate to the challenges and opportunities posited by digital media and technologies. A key arc of consideration is the seemingly linear and arguably triumphalist progression from “live” to “real time,” provisionally an arc from analog media to digital media. The chapter concludes with some example projects that combine television studies with approaches to streaming media and online participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 29. “ICYMI: Catching Up to the Moving Image Online,” by Gregory Zinman&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/59730&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ever-increasing scale of online video offers both a challenge and opportunity to scholars and students of the moving image. How can we make sense of so much material, and how does online video shape our understanding of the history and theory of the moving image? This chapter sets out three conceptual rubrics to help us think through online video: viewing, content, and genre. An accounting of the developing relationships between viewers and producers, individuals and communities, humans and technology, and industry and consumers allows for a new understanding of how the moving image is changing in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 30. “Images on the Move: Analytics for a Mixed Methods Approach,” by Virginia Kuhn&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academia.edu/36670942/Chapter_30_Images_on_the_Move_Analytics_for_a_Mixed_Methods_Approach&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter argues for a mixed methods approach to research with moving image media. Given the medium’s complexity and its increasing ubiquity, some form of computational analysis is necessary, not to replace other forms of humanities-based inquiry, but rather to extend and enhance these methods. Noting that, to date, tools developed for this purpose have focused either on textual tagging and annotation or on image processing, the author suggests combining the two processes to render video archives discoverable and searchable. The chapter ends with a brief survey of some nascent but compelling research that combines neuroscience and cinema studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 31. “Lost in the Clouds: A Media Theory of the Flight Recorder,” by Paul Benzon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay traces the history of the flight recorder–the technology colloquially known as the black box–across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, from its earliest photographic incarnations in the 1930s to current debates around wireless, cloud-based flight recording. Through this history, I treat the flight recorder as an exemplary object of media archaeology, a critical subfield of media studies that attends to issues such as obsolescence, forgetting, and nonlinear histories of technological change. Approaching the flight recorder through media archaeology illustrates the importance of storage and ephemerality to a critical approach to contemporary digital culture. If we take the flight recorder as a test case for these questions, we become more able to see the need for a perspective within media studies that attends to the complex materiality of the digital archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 32. “Scaffolding, Hard and Soft: Critical and Generative Infrastructures,” by Shannon Mattern&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordsinspace.net/shannon/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mattern_scaffolding_routledge.pdf&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructures are the networks and platforms–as well as the institutional structures and operations–that bring us goods and services, including communication and informational resources. Thinking about media and design through the framework of infrastructure enables us to expand the scale, historical scope, and material and social complexity through which we understand our mediated and designed environments and practices. Media and design work – both critical and creative – can not only promote infrastructural literacy, but can also contribute to the development of new, or better, infrastructural systems that embody the values we want to define our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV. Remediation, Data, Memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How is media preserved in the humanities? What role does it play in memory? When does it become “data”? And how does it change across formats over time? Moving between new and old media, the past and present, this section of the Companion addresses these questions and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 33. “Obsolescence and Innovation in the Age of the Digital,” by Kathleen Fitzpatrick&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:19301/&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concepts &lt;em&gt;obsolescence&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt; demonstrate not only a complex relationship between contemporary consumer culture and temporality (in which the past is somehow produced by the future) but also an equal complexity at the heart of contemporary cultural criticism (in which our ways of reading and understanding appear to require constant upgrades in order to stay current). This chapter explores the lenticular logic of obsolescence and innovation, in which each concept is defined by and inseparable from the other, and the effects that logic might have on our understanding of digital media and of ourselves in the act of engaging with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 34. “Futures of the Book,” by Jon Bath, Alyssa Arbuckle, Constance Crompton, Alex Christie, Ray Siemens, and the INKE Research Group&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:18673/&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we examine the relationship between the printed book and the electronic book, but not as a progression from the old to the new. We begin by looking at how the electronic book has been shaped by understandings of printed books. Electronic text was initially created to encode pre-existing books and continues to carry traces of this materiality forward. As we reveal the depth of this influence it becomes clear that the e-book, and the infrastructure that supports it, have been built by those with a very narrow understanding of what a “book” is; an Amazon Kindle may be a marvelous tool for reading novels, but it should be remembered that novels themselves are a fairly recent development in the book’s existence. In opposition to this singular definition of a book, we provide an example, the &lt;em&gt;Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript&lt;/em&gt;, of how a more fulsome understanding of the socially and institutionally contingent forms that books (and authors, editors, and readers) have taken can result in an e-book that respects, reflects upon, and responds to the book in all its diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 35. “Becoming a Rap Genius: African American Literary Studies and Collaborative Annotation,” by Howard Rambsy II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explains the processes of using the crowd-sourced annotation site, Rap Genius, for pedagogical purposes in African American literature courses. The chapter first provides brief background on Genius and then summarizes the implementation of two “Becoming a Rap Genius” courses. Finally, it addresses the implications of offering students opportunities to take African American literature courses with a technological or online basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 36. “Traversals: A Method of Preservation for Born-Digital Texts,” by Dene Grigar and Stuart Moulthrop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter describes a method of preserving works of digital creativity by documenting the experience of play, assembly, navigation, and co-performance that represents a traversal of the work in its original technical context. We discuss outcomes of &lt;em&gt;Pathfinders&lt;/em&gt;, a multi-year project focusing on five works of early electronic literature. Traversals of these works, accompanied by oral history interviews, generate important insights into the nature and history of computational art. Considering the affordances and limits of traversals, we suggest ways to integrate our approach with other strategies of preservation, including archiving, migration, and emulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 37. “New Media Arts: Creativity on the Way to the Archive,” by Timothy Murray&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, artists enthusiastically embraced the creative and archival dynamics of the digital interface. In recounting the parameters of this history and its institutional context, this chapter reflects on the range of interactive interfaces embraced by the artistic community, from the CD-ROM to net.art. While individual artists collaborated with programmers and designers to expand the limits of artistic expression, emergent arts organizations and archives worked with artists to develop portable platforms for their artworks.  The expanding power of the internet and informal international networks of new media arts provided unanticipated opportunities for building broad and diverse artistic collectives. In recognition that digital formats were far less stable than initially imagined, preservation developed into a predominant concern of new media art curators, often in tension with the artists’ enthusiasm for the embrace of unpredictable and unstable formats and their affection for the artistic ephemerality associated with performance, installation, and online interaction. Ironically, the archival celebration of memory, interactivity, and digital durability that propelled artistic creation in the early 1990s became the new millennial threat to new media’s archival future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 38. “Apprehending the Past: Augmented Reality, Archives, and Cultural Memory,” by Victoria Szabo&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/19527&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay explores the state of, and potential for, mobile augmented reality (AR) for digital heritage applications within urban environments. It takes as its focus the notion that “apprehension” of the past serves as a valuable complement to traditional comprehension-based approaches to understanding historical sites. Drawing upon experiential learning theory, critical theories of space and place, and digital interaction design principles, it suggests that location-based or “situated” access to archival resources offers opportunities both for deeper visitor engagement with historic sites and urban spaces and for new, multimodal approaches to digital humanities project development. This approach explores sharing scholarly research and received knowledge on site and on location, while at the same time offering opportunities for active engagement for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 39. “Experiencing Digital Africana Studies: Bringing the Classroom to Life,” by Bryan Carter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With attention to the Virtual Harlem project as well as to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, this chapter outlines several approaches to teaching Digital Africana Studies. Creating memorable classroom experiences is an inherent part of every assignment in the Digital Africana Studies environment. Through interaction, engaging activities, experiential learning, and meaningful digital projects, it is possible to shape ideas about Africana topics that may have a better chance at becoming an inherent part of a learner’s consciousness. Digital Africana Studies not only teaches students about a culture; courses are also designed to connect and immerse students in a way different from traditional approaches to literature and history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 40. “Engagements with Race, Memory, and the Built Environment in South Africa: A Case Study in Digital Humanities,” by Angel Nieves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, scholars and community leaders have experimented with the use of new digital technologies to tell the history of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. Technologies now at our disposal allow us to layer victim testimony in hypertexts using multiple tools for mapping, text mining, and 3-D visualizations. Digital humanities may also help analyze documentation so as to reconstruct and recover an alternative historical narrative in the face of conventional wisdom or officializing histories. The layering of the many narratives also helps lay bare the messiness of archive making, the methodologies of digital ethnography, and, in particular, the endangered nature of those archives across South Africa related to the Soweto Uprisings of June 1976.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 41. “Relationships, Not Records: Digital Heritage and the Ethics of Sharing Indigenous Knowledge Online,” by Kimberly Christen&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kimchristen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/41christenKimberly.pdf&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although physical archives were never intended to be input, they are often defined as places where one deposits materials. Over the last ten years, however, with digital tools and platforms that rely on user-generated content growing in popularity, curation has been linked to an outward-facing public view. In digital humanities and media studies, using archival content or generating one’s own archive has become prevalent. Remixing content from online sources and mining archives for data are seen as beneficial forms of digital knowledge creation. What is marginalized in these practices are the histories of archival content creation, diverse ethical systems of knowledge management, and cultural values that highlight differential access to material. Examining Indigenous systems of knowledge sheds light on alternative forms of archival practices and opens another avenue for collaboration and digital production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 42. “Searching, Mining, and Interpreting Media History’s Big Data,” by Eric Hoyt, Tony Tran, Derek Long, Kit Hughes, and Kevin Ponto&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://uwmadison.app.box.com/s/61nwqfp8r3sf413iscwjhcuyf3u9xqh5&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As search has become a key tool in how we conduct research, this chapter introduces Scaled Entity Search (SES), an alternative method to traditional keyword searching, and Arclight, a software platform for applying SES to media history sources (search.projectarclight.org). In exploring how search works as a method, we highlight the potential strengths and limitations SES and Arclight can bring to historical research. SES enables users to perform searches for multiple entities simultaneously across a large body of documents, as well as a critical framework for interpreting their search results. With Arclight, users can employ the SES method, which allows them to visualize and examine how entities trend across the Media History Digital Library’s 2 million-page corpus. Using the popular Japanese American silent film actors, Sessue Hayakawa and Tsuru Aoki, as examples, we demonstrate how SES and Arclight can be productively applied to new historical questions and confirm and enrich existing historical scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 43. “The Intimate Lives of Cultural Objects,” by Jeffrey Schnapp&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffreyschnapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Intimate-Lives-of-Cultural-Objects.pdf&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter is concerned with the manifold ways in which cultural objects are represented, from the standardized data schemes that translate them into fields such as title, creator, date, place of creation, medium, and provenance to the representations (photographic and other) that seek to capture aspects of their existence or meaning. It argues for expanded modes of registration, record-making, and linking that thicken and enrich the experience of cultural objects, whether from an informational or social standpoint or the standpoint of the sensory data they convey, whether on the micro level (as individual physical things) or on the macro level (as elements within aggregates such as entire collections). In so doing, it suggests that the critical skills associated with traditional humanistic approaches to the art of description should be brought to bear both on data schemes as well as in the design of hybrid digital/analog experiences of objects in galleries and museums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 44. “Timescape and Memory: Visualizing Big Data at the 9/11 Memorial Museum,” by Lauren F. Klein&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/59435&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter positions &lt;em&gt;Timescape&lt;/em&gt; (Local Projects, 2014), a large-scale data visualization installed in the 9/11 Memorial Museum, as evidence of how humanistic inquiry must stand alongside data visualization and other computational practices if we are to most fully address the complexity of twenty-first-century daily life. I demonstrate how &lt;em&gt;Timescape&lt;/em&gt;, and all data visualizations, must be analyzed on three levels: 1) at the level of the data-image, 2) at the level of data-processing, and 3) at the level of the dataset itself. By analyzing &lt;em&gt;Timescape&lt;/em&gt; according to this scheme, I show how the piece must be interpreted so as to better understand the assumptions and arguments embedded in its design. I claim that the knowledge produced by data visualization is always partial, and that no quantity of data, however large, and however it might be visualized, can be made to represent the global impact of 9/11 in a single view. I conclude that &lt;em&gt;Timescape&lt;/em&gt;, as a result of its relation to 9/11 as a media event, does not merely produce knowledge in the particular terms that its algorithms identify and visualize; it also represents the larger process of knowledge production itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V. Making, Programming, Hacking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Practices such as making, programming, and hacking entwine in many ways with writing, ethnography, and even archival work. Underscoring the critical and creative dimensions of these practices, this section surveys noninstrumentalist approaches to code, platforms, and machines that privilege inquiry over proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 45. “Programming as Literacy,” by Annette Vee&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/37085/&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Computer programming is the new literacy,” say countless popular articles on education. In fact, the claims for programming as a kind of literacy stretch back to the 1960s. Linking programming to literacy is rhetorically expeditious because literacy can be an argument for funding and political support. But connections between programming and writing are more than political savvy: like writing, programming is a symbolic system operating through an inscribed language and social contexts. This chapter introduces several influential projects that have posited programming as a literacy, provides logical reasons for these connections, points to several legal cases that demonstrate how programming functions like (and unlike) writing, and concludes by pointing to several ways the humanities can contribute to understandings of computer programming as part of the environment in which people now dwell and communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 46. “Expressive Processing: Interpretation and Creation,” by Noah Wardrip-Fruin&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5453x2sb&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software Studies approaches use humanities and/or social science methods and engage the specific operations of particular software – for purposes ranging from understanding digital culture to the development of procedural literacy and the creation of novel software. “Expressive processing” names a particular software studies approach that focuses on the (perhaps unconscious) ideas, as well as intellectual and material histories, expressed through the design and operation of computational processes. Using this approach to examine existing works can reveal something quite different from what software authors state publicly, as this chapter outlines with Abelson and Carroll’s “Goldwater Machine.” This approach can also help guide the creation of new works, complementing techniques such as playtesting and arts critique, as this chapter outlines with the social simulation storytelling game, &lt;em&gt;Prom Week&lt;/em&gt;. Through such work, we can not only better understand the computational media that shapes our society, but also develop perspectives that can help us understand software more generally and find ways to extend what it can express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 47. “Building Interactive Stories,” by Anastasia Salter&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:25217/&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactive stories sit at the intersection of many fields and forms, including games, comics, electronic literature, hypertext, and interactive fiction. An interactive story is any narrative-driven experience in which the reader becomes a user or player by becoming a participant in the work, usually through clicking, choosing, or exploring. This intersection has created many challenges in defining and recognizing interactive stories, as it often leads to grouping interactive stories that share particular platforms or technologies without recognizing the larger characteristics of a growing form. Building interactive stories requires considering narrative in terms of interaction and simulation, which can transform our relationship with a text and allow readers to explore choices and spaces. Open source platforms, including Twine and Inform 7, offer affordances and accessible methods for building procedural systems that take advantage of these structures for designing story-driven experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 48. “Reading Culture through Code,” by Mark C. Marino&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:19537/&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of source code is an emerging approach to interpreting digital texts. This chapter introduces the methodologies of Critical Code Studies (CCS), situates it within the landscape of media and technology studies, and models the interpretive practices through a few case studies to demonstrate how understanding source code can enrich readings of technoculture through electronic texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 49. “Critical Unmaking: Toward a Queer Computation,” by Jacob Gaboury&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0cq870wh&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay explores the intersection of queer theory and critical practices in digital humanities, offering up a critique of our impulse toward productivity and making through an engagement with critical practices of unmaking. Engaging with queer discourses on the politics of failure alongside tactical and artistic practices in glitch studies, computer history, and critical code studies, the essay looks to model various modes of working with digital technologies to critique the ideological and technological assumptions that structure them. In acknowledging the challenge of making queer bodies, identities, and theories legible to digital media, the essay calls for further experimentation by scholars, artists, and students of digital humanities to think technology, sexuality, and identity together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 50. “Making Things to Make Sense of Things: DIY as Research and Practice,” by Kat Jungnickel&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://research.gold.ac.uk/18377/3/50jungnickelKat.pdf&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter is about making as research or, more specifically, making things to make sense of things. I draw on a mixed method project about the cycling boom of the late nineteenth century, gender relations, and radical feminist cultures of invention. The 1890s were a remarkable period of socio-technical change. Here, the history of Victorian women’s inventiveness is rendered visible in the form of design patents for new types of cycle wear, specifically “convertible” costumes that enabled the wearer to adapt street wear to cycle wear when required. As a tactic for making sense of the complexity of these designs, I collaborated with an interdisciplinary research team – pattern cutter, weaver, and artist – to sew a collection of convertible cycle wear inspired by these patents. Taking a DIY (Do-It-Yourself) ethic as both a central theme in the research and my practice, I discuss what emerges in this process of learning from doing, rendering public the mess, mistakes, and tangential happenings and how making and entangling through design histories surfaces new and different ways of exploring mobilities, gender relations, and inventive practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 51. “Environmental Sensing and ‘Media’ as Practice in the Making,” by Jennifer Gabrys&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://research.gold.ac.uk/19517/1/Gabrys_DHCompanion_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental sensors are proliferating for a range of uses within the wider context of the Internet of Things. Sensors are also being taken up as low-cost digital technologies that allow citizens to monitor their environments, collect data, and report on events such as pollution. These emerging sets of practices, often termed “citizen sensing,” present new questions for how participation, sensing, and citizenship are understood and practiced within the context of digital media. Through a review of technologies, practices, and literature, this chapter outlines the newly developing area of citizen sensing and then discusses one research project, Citizen Sense, which undertakes a practice-based and participatory investigation into the possibilities and issues that arise with citizen sensing. Ultimately, the chapter suggests that citizen sensing presents new methods and approaches for understanding digital media in and through practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 52. “Approaching Design as Inquiry: Magic, Myth, and Metaphor in Digital Fabrication,” by Daniela Rosner&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/files/52rosnerDanielaK.pdf&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter considers three projects of digital fabrication and the productivist and integrated approaches to design inquiry they set in motion. In reflecting on these cases and scholarship from media studies and digital humanities, I show how digital production becomes a means rather than an end, a mechanism by which researchers might mutually engage their sites of study. Using this integrated approach, I locate small-scale manufacturing prototypes in a wider historical context of “mimetic machinery”: machines for mechanical reproduction that draw their symbolic power from a material connection with the phenomena represented.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unlearning the Internet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed for 108 students across the disciplines, “Unlearning the Internet” (Spring 2019) was an undergraduate course about how social norms and cultural histories shape habits of internet research and communication. I asked students to engage these norms through weekly case studies and workshops about how, for whom, by whom, and under what assumptions the internet is made. Topics included the myth of lone male inventors, the rhetoric of raw data, the ostensible autonomy of algorithms, and the ideology of cyberspace as a landless territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course concluded with a “festival” on campus, where students shared their own zines on the course theme. Many of the zines combined cultural criticism with pedagogies of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course was the fifth introduction to digital studies I’ve taught at UVic. While, in the first few introductions, I focused on teaching software, programming, and academic debates, “Unlearning the Internet” gravitated toward tool-agnostic practice, historically informed design, and flexible strategies for addressing technologies with labor and culture in mind. Most of the workshops, for instance, relied on low-tech approaches and paper prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official description of “Unlearning the Internet” is below, together with a link to the course website, my notes, the syllabus in PDF, and posters for both the course and the zine fest. I want to thank teaching assistants, Stefan Higgins, Ria Karve, and Ian Michael Waddell, for working with me on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet runs on habits. This course prompts us to change them from the inside. We will study ignored histories of digital stuff, examine dominant beliefs about technologies, and compose our own content, from audio and images to visualizations and websites. Each week will be dedicated to a popular misconception, such as the fallacy of automation and the myth of the lone male inventor, all with the goal of making critical media, with the past in mind, in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical competencies assumed: know how to send an email.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Glossary of Media Projects</title>

        <title>Designing Grad Courses</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This resource is drawn from a talk I gave on 26 April 2018 at the University of Washington’s Simpson Center for the Humanities. It’s titled, “Locating Praxis in Digital Studies: Designing Courses for Graduate Students.” While the talk’s intended for the Department of English at UW, and I reviewed their course offerings when I wrote it, the material does its best to speak to a broader audience, namely graduate programs across the humanities that are considering digital studies as part of their curricula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an outline for the talk and resource:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#locating-praxis-in-digital-studies-designing-courses-for-graduate-students&quot;&gt;Introduction and Context&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#my-background-and-biases&quot;&gt;My Background and Biases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#praxis&quot;&gt;Praxis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-aims-of-my-digital-studies-courses&quot;&gt;The Aims of My Digital Studies Courses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#some-possible-three-course-sequences&quot;&gt;Some Possible Three-Course Sequences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;References&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three-course sequences are presented in the areas of stewardship, computational analysis, design and communication, social justice and transformative media, digital methods, and prototyping. For each, I use “digital studies” instead of “digital humanities” or “The Digital Humanities” as a framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;locating-praxis-in-digital-studies-designing-courses-for-graduate-students&quot;&gt;Locating Praxis in Digital Studies: Designing Courses for Graduate Students&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t teach skills. Teach competences. . . . Computers can do better things than that.&lt;/em&gt; – Sandy Stone (2007) at the European Graduate School&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been asked by the Department of English at the University of Washington to: 1) outline what humanities graduate students need in terms of digital knowledge for the future, no matter what field they enter following graduation, and 2) speak to what a three-course, cross-disciplinary sequence in the foundations of digital humanities (DH) might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Department of English for inviting me to speak on this topic, and to the Simpson Center for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for their support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a disclosure of sorts . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-background-and-biases&quot;&gt;My Background and Biases&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My academic background is mostly in “literary media” (a combination of science and technology studies, technoculture studies, multimodal composition and design, and research on 20th and 21st c. experimental literature and media). I do not, for instance, have a background in textual studies or humanities computing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I tend to run with a rather capacious definition of digital humanities (DH): a combination of technical competences in computing and/or new media with research in a humanities discipline. I also tend to accept Manovich’s five principles of new media (at least as a starting point): new media are modular, variable, automated, represented numerically, and transcoded (2001). And I frame the idea of technical work rather broadly, too: from encoding and programming to understanding how a given mechanism works or communicating how it affects social relations. I do not, for instance, believe that everyone (including everyone in digital humanities) should know how to code. At the same time, I admire work being done in creative and critical computing (Ford 2015; Parrish 2018), and I often program as part of my teaching and research.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I try to avoid using the term, “DH.” It’s a label regularly &lt;em&gt;assigned&lt;/em&gt; (occasionally after the fact) to existing research; and, to speak candidly, it “is a means and not an end” (Kirschenbaum 2012). I’m not particularly interested in &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; digital humanities as a term or field (including who or what “belongs”) (Bianco 2012). I’m interested in work that entwines technical stuff with experimental methods. Such work is usually collaborative and transdisciplinary, involving a shared problem or concern approached through a combination of different disciplines and distinct forms of expertise. It involves knowing what you don’t know and trusting others (in other areas of expertise) with whom you collaborate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m totally fine with prototypes. Digital projects do not need to be fully developed products or polished/useful tools made in labs or centers to be meaningful. Prototypes serve important cultural, pedagogical, and artistic functions. I also lean toward the conjectural or speculative dimensions of digital studies (that is, my work does not involve proving anything with quantification or computers). I prefer to treat computation and technologies as modes (not objects or means) of inquiry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m also totally fine with a slow-moving digital humanities (Berg and Seeber 2016). Although the word “digital” is frequently associated with “fast,” “light,” “fleeting,” and even “easy” (Kirschenbaum 2008), digital projects (especially collaborative ones) require a significant amount of time, labor, deliberation, and experimentation. They demand planning ten or even twenty years ahead, to account for matters of care and maintenance, not to mention changes in standards and technologies. Without significant institutional support, many projects also rely heavily on precarity (e.g., one-year positions, voluntary contributions, and grant cycles) as well as conspicuous boundaries between “service” (technical skills) and “research” (articles and monographs), making it difficult for many practitioners to become invested in the work or to envision (let alone act upon) a long-term future in digital initiatives. It is important, then, for projects to commit to people and cultures, not just gadgets and data (Posner 2014).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;praxis&quot;&gt;Praxis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where digital knowledge and course design are concerned, I’ve decided for today to approach both in the abstract: with detail, but without a specific setting or program in mind. A lot of what I’m going to say may apply to what you’re already doing at your institution (UW or elsewhere); however, my intent is to step away from the specificity of context and provide a resource that will allow us to first scan DH and its affordances for teaching and learning and then locate the praxis of digital studies where we wish. I’m sure, too, that I’ll miss or overlook something in the process. For example, I will not talk much about undergraduate education, which is crucial and also morphing alongside (or through) new media and digital studies. Nevertheless, some of this material could and probably should apply to undergraduate course design and instruction. At my institution (UVic), where we have five undergraduate courses in digital humanities (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.uvic.ca/calendar2018-01/CDs/DHUM/150.html&quot;&gt;DHum&lt;/a&gt;), that is certainly the case. I will also not talk much about courses in the scholarship of teaching and learning, even though pedagogy is of course foundational to digital studies and graduate education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say “praxis,” I’m referring to the enactment and diffraction of theory through situated knowledge (Haraway 1988), embodied practice (Hayles 1999), and “live” methods and prototyping (Back and Puwar 2012). From my perspective, the ideal teaching and learning situation (in the context of digital studies) is an entanglement of theory with practice, resulting in practitioner knowledge of, and responsibility for, where and why they habitually draw the boundaries or “cuts” between discourse and matter or concepts and actions (Barad 2007; Kember and Zylinska 2012). And I frequently use “digital studies” here (as opposed to digital humanities or &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Digital Humanities) because some of the material, including methods and ostensible foundations, may not immediately appear to be unique to the humanities, invested (only) in DH, or taught only by humanities scholars or only in the humanities classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-aims-of-my-digital-studies-courses&quot;&gt;The Aims of My Digital Studies Courses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my own background and biases in mind, and with an orientation toward praxis and identifying what may be helpful for students to know, my digital studies courses (or more accurately, my courses involving digital studies) usually prompt students to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify and intervene in oppressive technologies (including matters of social justice, ethics, trust, and responsibility), while recognizing that “intervention” assumes various modes, from ideation and composition to implementation and community building;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand design and development as forms of inquiry with palpable contexts of use (comparable to writing or even to moving through an archive);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Approach projects from the middle (against hyperbolic rhetorics of innovation, novelty, and disruption as well as lone male inventor myths);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attend to the cultural, social, and aesthetic dimensions of how this becomes that (an ontology of memory, changes, and versions, not storage, originals, and copies);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bridge macro-, meso-, and micro-levels of interpretation (resisting the close/distant and critical/immersive binaries); and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refine knowledge amidst an abundance of information and gadgets, including knowing when to logout or unplug, how to avoid scope creep, and why maintenance and carework are not lateral consequences of projects, but rather comprise their core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a lot of that doesn’t sound very “digital.” And I think that’s important for humanities work: an instance of digital studies that is culture first, technology second. That is, digital studies need not force some rupture between humanities and digital humanities, resort to digital humanities evangelism, or assume digital humanities will save academic programs, build new institutional units, or increase numbers and productivity (Koh 2015). Digital studies can instead recognize existing histories and methods within the humanities and then critique, reject, or change them where need be. For instance, the praxis of the above aims may be labeled or situated like so (with apologies for the conspicuous pith):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Technical Practice (Science and Technology Studies)&lt;/strong&gt; (Agre 1997; Bardzell and Bardzell 2013; Noble 2018; Ratto 2011): Identify and intervene in oppressive technologies (including matters of social justice, ethics, trust, and responsibility), while recognizing that “intervention” assumes various modes, from ideation and composition to implementation and community building;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflexive Iteration and Trial-and-Error Experimentation (Design Studies)&lt;/strong&gt; (Balsamo 2011; Perner-Wilson 2011; Rosner 2018): Understand design and development as forms of inquiry with palpable contexts of use (comparable to writing or even to moving through an archive);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provenance and Documentation (History, Textual Studies, and Library and Information Studies)&lt;/strong&gt; (Brown and Simpson 2015; Getty 2016; Marvin 1990; Millar 2002; Nowviskie 2013): Approach projects from the middle (against hyperbolic rhetorics of innovation and disruption as well as lone male inventor myths);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traversal and Transduction (Literary and Media Studies)&lt;/strong&gt; (Chun 2011; Fuller 2005; Kress 2010; Moulthrop and Grigar 2017; Sterne 2003): Attend to the cultural, social, and aesthetic dimensions of how this becomes that (an ontology of memory, changes, and versions, not storage, originals, and copies);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Articulation (Cultural Studies)&lt;/strong&gt; (Grossberg 1992; Hall 1990; Morris 1990): Bridge macro-, meso-, and micro-levels of interpretation (resisting the close/distant and critique/immersion binaries); and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Computing (Labor Studies)&lt;/strong&gt; (Gil 2015; Kirschenbaum 2009; Reed 2014; Risam 2018; Scholz 2013): Refine knowledge amidst an abundance of information and gadgets, including knowing when to logout or unplug, how to avoid scope creep, and why maintenance and carework are not lateral consequences of projects, but rather comprise their core. (I recognize that minimal computing is nowhere near as established as the other forms of praxis mentioned here. That said, with a GO::DH working group, I’ve done my best to &lt;a href=&quot;http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/02/minimal-definitions/&quot;&gt;outline what minimal computing may entail&lt;/a&gt;. It’s very much a work in progress.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I design, develop, and teach my own courses in/around digital studies (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/150f2015/&quot;&gt;Digital Humanities 150&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jentery.github.io/ts200/&quot;&gt;Technology and Society 200&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/466f2015/&quot;&gt;English 466 (Cultural Studies)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jentery.github.io/507/&quot;&gt;Digital Literary Studies 507&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jentery.github.io/508v2/&quot;&gt;Digital Literary Studies 508&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Victoria), the above aims routinely return me to questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the contexts of teaching digital studies and DH, &lt;em&gt;when does the content matter most?&lt;/em&gt; When does it influence methodology? And how does it determine or shape the method used? I ask these questions because DH courses are regularly framed as methods or skills courses. Must they be? When do particular content areas demand specific digital methods? When are methods courses too superficial or too likely to overwhelm both students and instructors?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How technical should I get? &lt;em&gt;What can be done without computers or programming?&lt;/em&gt; When, if ever, must some of the foundations involve the command line or code? I ask these questions because I’m truly conflicted: many humanities students regularly (and justifiably) ask why they should bother with code, and the practice of teaching and learning technical stuff can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when you’re new to it. Thus, after many experiments with programming in the humanities classroom, I now tend to favor low-tech approaches in introductory and special topics courses (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DbVLxBLU8AAh3is.jpg&quot;&gt;paper computers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaW4Xl5VwAAeqw8.jpg:large&quot;&gt;unlearning the internet&lt;/a&gt;), which may then spark curiosity about more technical work. And yet I still quite like the idea of situating technical work (including programming) under the broader umbrella of writing and composition. After all, practitioners argue and experiment with code (not just &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; or instrumentalize it) (Parrish 2018).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do students already know?&lt;/em&gt; What do they care most about? How can I be more aware of these investments and this knowledge? I ask these questions because I think my courses should be relevant to student needs and interests, and they should speak to present-day issues and concerns even when they are grounded in historical materials. I also realize that students are learning more and more digital stuff in K-12 settings. In K-12, areas such as media studies are increasingly entwined with literature and language studies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which approaches to teaching are most conducive to both social change and aesthetic experimentation?&lt;/em&gt; When and how should I get out of the way? I ask these questions because I want to give students room to test ideas and to learn and build on their own investments and backgrounds. Too often, digital studies courses begin with an assumption of lack (a banking model of education): “you don’t know this, and here’s how you should do it.” The thing is, there are millions of ways to approach a single problem or concern through digital methods and new media, and I believe it’s possible for instructors to simultaneously use their expertise &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; check their assumptions and privileges at the classroom door. I also enjoy teaching courses that encourage formal experimentation through, for example, a “toychest” approach (Liu 2013). Such courses teach competencies, not skills. And they can avoid implying that there’s one way to “do DH,” perform inquiry, or enact a technique.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I even need to talk about “The Digital Humanities” (the field) to teach this material?&lt;/em&gt; For whom does is that label important? At this point, do students hear “Digital Humanities” and think, “Look! My prof just found the internet”? I ask this question because, again, I think DH is a means and not an end. And that’s ok. I can teach those means in the classroom; and, to do it, I probably don’t need to label the course “Digital Humanities.” My own preference is to design and teach digital studies in the contexts of media studies, literary studies, and cultural studies courses. This way, I can focus on content (e.g., indie games, contemporary American novels, or 19th c. technologies) while relying on field designations already familiar to many or most students, without the need to explain &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Digital Humanities and its various histories and debates. This approach may also make more sense on student transcripts, require less administration, and be less divisive within faculties and departments. However, a lot, including the very definition of DH, depends on institutional context and even contexts across a single campus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;some-possible-three-course-sequences&quot;&gt;Some Possible Three-Course Sequences&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the granularity of my responses to the questions above is entangled with the courses I am teaching, for whom, and to whom. Still, my experiences in engaging such questions lead me to imagine several three-course, cross-disciplinary sequences in the foundations of digital humanities. For the purposes of discussion (but not proscription), I’ve prototyped them below. Pardon the rough edges; and, to state the obvious, selection of content (e.g., collections, corpora, media, genres, histories, theories, and case studies) would dramatically affect each of these sequences. None of these sequences is an argument against content expertise. Instead, each is meant to provide a &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt; for doing humanities-based work informed (and even transformed) by multiple disciplines, and perhaps by transdisciplinary concerns. Please also note that none of these sequences would even need the term “digital humanities” in their course titles, calendar descriptions, or the like. In fact, many, if not all, of them could bypass the word “digital,” too, in favor of terms such as media and mediation, which may more accurately attend to the issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stewardship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sequence overlaps the Humanities with work mostly in Information Studies and Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (GLAM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitization&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to various 2D and 3D techniques for digitizing and remediating materials. Techniques may include plain text (ASCII), text and image editing (Sublime, Git, Photoshop), encoding (XML), transforming (XSLT), character recognition (Abbyy, Scan Tailor), photogrammetry (Autodesk), video and audio recording (Audacity, Audition, Premiere), cryptography, data modeling, 3D modeling (Rhino), and 2D and 3D scanning. Emphasis is placed on the affordances of digitization for humanities research as well as on remediation’s historical and cultural dimensions (Bolter and Grusin 1998; Porter 2013).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collections&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to various techniques for collecting, preserving, and disseminating digital and digitized materials. Techniques may include cataloging, indexing, searching (Solr), metadata (Dublin Core), repositories (GitHub), infrastructure assessments, preservation, simulation (Unity), emulation (DOSBox), migration, digital editions (Ed.), repatriation, open access platforms (Mirador Viewer, Ten Thousand Rooms), and computer forensics (BitCurator). Emphasis is placed on stewarding humanities materials as well as stewardship as a social, cultural, and political activity (Bowker and Star 1999; Brown and Nicholas 2012).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibition&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to various techniques for curating and exhibiting digital and digitized materials. Techniques may include interface and interaction design, narration, databases (SQL, PHP), licensing (Creative Commons), attribution, and content management (Scalar, Omeka, Mukurtu). Emphasis is placed on matters of access (including protocols) as well as on the cultural and political dimensions of curation (Christen 2015).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of this sequence include scaffolded preparation for fields in or related to stewardship and memory work in academic and non-academic occupations. Each course could attend to a variety of material particulars across media and methods as well as to the colonial dimensions of stewardship and/as expropriation. Generally speaking, this sequence could link stewardship to communication, culture, and social responsibility, and it could build upon and amplify existing collections in libraries at the hosting institution, in partnership with local communities, where applicable. Here, material from the Social Justice and Transformative Media sequence (below) could be meaningfully integrated into the “Digitization,” “Collections,” and “Exhibition” courses. This sequence could also shape the content and methods of MA and PhD projects, including dissertations (see, e.g., Visconti 2014). It requires some investment in the more technical dimensions of digital humanities, and it may benefit from co-teaching across, e.g., Libraries and the Humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sequence overlaps the Humanities with work mostly in Computer Science, the Social Sciences, and Information Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to using computers to process and interpret materials. Techniques may include pre-processing data (OCR, stemming, lemmatization), text editing (Git, Sublime), the command line (Bash), tables and spreadsheets, repositories (GitHub), programming (Python), statistics (R), diffing (Git), text mining/analysis (Paper Machines, Voyant), topic modeling (MALLET), computer vision (OpenCV), and machine learning (torch-rnn). Emphasis is placed on the editorial choices made during processing and also on understanding what can be achieved (and not achieved) through computational methods (Underwood 2015).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expression&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to expressing materials as data. Techniques may include the command line (Bash), programming (Python and JavaScript), interface and interaction design, and graphical, (geo)spatial, temporal, and sonic data expression (D3, Vega, GIS, Processing). Emphasis is placed on data expression as a designed form of argumentation and social responsibility (Drucker 2014; Klein 2013).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to analyzing data for the purposes of disseminating and publishing findings. Techniques may include macroanalysis (Jockers 2013), surface reading (Best and Marcus 2009), close reading (Culler 2010), cultural analytics (Piper 2016; Manovich et al. 2007), pattern recognition (Long and So 2016), distant listening (Clement 2013), cinemetrics (Kuhn et al. 2014), and algorhythmics (Miyazaki 2012). Emphasis is placed on combining qualitative and quantitative methods and also on bridging macro-, meso-, and micro-levels of interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of this sequence include semi-scaffolded preparation for data- and computation-oriented humanities work across academic and non-academic occupations (including areas such as “data journalism”) and an investment in conducting computational analysis without relying too heavily on tools and templates. While the “Analysis” course could in principle come first or last, “Processing” would in theory precede “Expression.” The three courses could (and probably should) be grounded in particular areas and methods, such as textual analysis, visual studies, sound studies, or cinema studies, to refine the aims and focus. “Processing” would benefit especially from material in the Stewardship sequence (above), “Expression” would benefit especially from material in the Design and Communication sequence (below), and “Analysis” would benefit especially from material in the Social Justice and Transformative Media sequence (below). Additionally, the results of many techniques at play in this sequence may be communicated in print or proto-print communications (see, e.g., MacArthur, Zellou, and Miller 2018). The sequence requires significant investment in the more technical dimensions of digital humanities (and thus could be a challenge for many Humanities faculty and staff), and it may benefit from co-teaching across, e.g., the Humanities and Computer Science, the Social Sciences, and/or Information Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design and Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sequence overlaps the Humanities with work mostly in Fine Arts, Design, and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Composition&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to multimodal composition within academic contexts and on the fringes. Techniques may include writing for the web (HTML, Markdown, JavaScript, Jekyll, and CSS), visual programming (Max/MSP), game design (Twine, Unity), and the production, post-production, and synthesis of audio, film, images, and text (Adobe Creative Suite, Unity). Emphasis is placed on scholarly communication and publishing as well as on contexts of use and interpretation (Arola, Sheppard, and Ball 2014).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to design’s role in the scholarly communication process. Techniques may include accessibility and assistive technologies (Hendren 2012) as well as graphic (Drucker and McVarish 2013), interface (Emerson 2014; Mak 2011), interaction (Ruecker 2015), adversarial (DiSalvo 2012), and speculative design (Dunne and Raby 2013). Emphasis is placed on cultural and critical inquiry through design practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiments&lt;/strong&gt;: This course surveys histories of experimental media and their relevance to present-day practices. Areas studied may include electronic literature (Hayles 2008), net art (Murray et al. 2012), manifestos (Caws 2001), design fiction (Sterling 2009), comics (Sousanis 2015), visualizations (Daniel and Loyer 2008), film (Mulvey 1975) documents (Gitelman 2014), zines (Radway 2011), book arts (Drucker 1995), indie games (Anthropy 2012), sound and performance art (Keeling and Kun 2012; Rodgers 2010; Taylor 2016), noise (Rose 1994), tactical media (Raley 2009), media archaeology (Huhtamo and Parikka 2011), and infrastructure studies (Mattern 2017; Parks and Starosielski 2015). Emphasis is placed on the importance of materiality, design, and media aesthetics to cultural, social, and political practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of this sequence include semi-scaffolded preparation for humanities-based design and communication fields involving academic and non-academic occupations. It could also foreground history and politics in the design and composition process, without requiring the courses to follow any particular order. Where applicable, it could (and probably should) be grounded in a particular area of practice, history, and cultural study, such as book history, game studies, writing studies, experimental media, or interface design. Areas like these would give the sequence more granularity and focus, especially since design and communication are quite broad. All three courses would benefit from material in the Social Justice and Transformative Media sequence (below), with some of the design dimensions of “Processing” and “Expression” (above) as well as the curatorial dimensions of the Stewardship sequence. The sequence requires some investment in the more technical dimensions of digital humanities, and it may benefit from co-teaching across, e.g., the Humanities and Design, Fine Arts, and/or Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Justice and Transformative Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sequence overlaps the Humanities with work mostly in the Social Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Technical Practice&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to the fundamentals of critical technical practice and its entanglements with critical making, code, and design (Agre 1997; Bardzell and Bardzell 2013; Marino 2006; Ratto 2011). Techniques may include programming (Python, Processing), documentation (Git, GitHub), user/player testing, scenario prototyping, licensing (Creative Commons), hacking (Coleman 2013; Losh 2012; Ross 1990), glitching (Menkman 2009), algorithm audits (Sandvig et al. 2014), missing datasets (Onuoha 2016), micro_research and creative research (Howse 2010; Office of Creative Research 2017), minimal computing (Gil 2015), and labor assessments. Emphasis is placed on legacies of instrumentalism but also on technical practice as a reflective, diffractive, and political activity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;: This course focuses on social and cultural transformation with and through experimental methods and radical media. Topics may include digital labor and attention economics (Beller 2006; Nakamura 2009; Scholz 2013), shadow work (Illich 1981), algocracy (Aneesh 2006), the general intellect (Dyer-Witheford 1999), decolonization and radical media (Ngũgĩ 1986; Tuck and Yang 2012), the space of flows and land as pedagogy (Castells 2013; Simpson 2014), #transformDH (Lothian and Phillips 2013), black code and black digital humanities (Gallon 2016; Johnson and Neal 2017), decolonial computing and archiving (Ali 2016; Cushman 2013), Afrofuturisms (Nelson 2002), Indigenous futures (Dillon 2012), informatics of domination (Haraway 1984), poetic operations (cárdenas 2016), technologies and/as reproductive labor (Federici 1974; Murphy 2012), feminist media praxis (Ada New Media; FemTechNet; McPherson 2018), disability and universal design (Hamraie 2017), colonialism and non-English programming (Nasser 2012), embodiment and framing (Sneha 2018), micro-history and 3D reconstruction (Sullivan, Nieves, and Snyder 2018), critical algorithm studies (Crawford 2016; Noble 2018), queer OS and computing (Blas 2007-12; Gaboury 2013; Keeling 2014), data and network sovereignty (Duarte 2017), archives and activism (Bracero History Archive 2018; Devor 2016; Women Who Rock 2011), neuroqueerness and communication (Yergeau 2017), data shed and security (Wernimont 2016; Soundararajan et al. 2018), DIY making (Anthropy 2012), and intersectional approaches to technologies and new media. Emphasis is placed on interventions (historical and present-day) in technologies and technocultures of oppression.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Research&lt;/strong&gt;: This workshop (or directed study) is an opportunity for you to develop, implement, and reflect on your own action research project, in collaboration with a community partner or internship program (where applicable) and with advising from a faculty member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of this sequence include a semi-scaffolded approach to transformative media and justice work in academic and non-academic occupations. It could appeal to students who are already interested in cultural studies, science and technology studies, media studies, and/or critical theory but are unfamiliar with or skeptical of digital humanities. The sequence also affords some flexibility for both students and faculty. Given the range of possibilities, “Transformation” would probably manifest in ways analogous to special topics courses, with “Critical Technical Practice” building on material from Stewardship (above), Computational Analysis (above), and Design and Communication (above). “Critical Technical Practice” and “Transformation” could then be combined through the praxis-based orientation of “Action Research.” The sequence (especially “Critical Technical Practice”) requires some investment in the more technical dimensions of digital humanities, and it may benefit from co-teaching across, e.g., Social Sciences, Design, and Information Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sequence is anchored in Digital Humanities as a field. It is methods-forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remediating and Structuring&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to the fundamentals of remediating materials and structuring data for interpretation in the humanities. Emphasis is placed on developing a working understanding of the various practices involved in stewardship and curation. Core materials draw from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dh-notes/dhnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental Methods in the Humanities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia University), &lt;a href=&quot;https://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IntroductionToDigitalHumanities_Textbook.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Humanities 101&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (UCLA).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming and Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to the fundamentals of computer programming, data expression, and algorithmic analysis for interpretation in the humanities. Emphasis is placed on developing a working understanding of the practices involved in humanities-based computation. Core materials draw from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dh-notes/dhnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental Methods in the Humanities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia University), &lt;a href=&quot;https://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IntroductionToDigitalHumanities_Textbook.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Humanities 101&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (UCLA).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design and Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to the fundamentals of designing, communicating with, and transforming media in the humanities. Emphasis is placed on developing a working understanding of the practices and responsibilities involved in multimodal scholarly communication, especially as it relates to matters of ethics and social justice. Core materials draw from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dh-notes/dhnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental Methods in the Humanities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Columbia University), &lt;a href=&quot;https://programminghistorian.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IntroductionToDigitalHumanities_Textbook.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Humanities 101&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (UCLA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of this sequence include flexibility for students, faculty, and staff as well as for the content and methods offered. “Remediating and Structuring” is a condensed version of the Stewardship sequence (above), “Programming and Analysis” is a condensed version of the Computational Analysis sequence (above), and “Design and Transformation” is a condensed version of the Design and Communication and Social Justice and Transformative Media sequences (above). In principle, “Design and Transformation” could be offered first or last, with “Remediating and Structuring” preceding “Programming and Analysis.” The core materials (&lt;em&gt;Experimental Methods&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Programming Historian&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DH 101&lt;/em&gt;) could also be used in other sequences (above), and methods and topics from the Social Justice and Transformative Media sequence (above) could be integrated into every class in this sequence. The risk of this sequence is surveying too much material too quickly. It would also require a significant range of experience and expertise where faculty, students, and staff are concerned. The sequence requires significant investment in the more technical dimensions of digital humanities, and it may benefit from co-teaching across the disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototyping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sequence is anchored in digital studies as a speculative or conjectural practice. It is content- and project-forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototyping in the Humanities&lt;/strong&gt;: This course surveys various prototyping techniques, from paper to scenario to video prototyping. Emphasis is placed on using these techniques to ask “what if” of humanities materials, to observe change and embodied experiences, and to trace and share lines of inquiry (Kraus 2009; Drucker and Nowviskie 2007; Rosner 2018). You will be asked to keep a design document or log throughout the course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototyping Pasts and Futures&lt;/strong&gt;: This course introduces you to using experimental methods and multimodal composition to conjecture about pasts and futures. You will work with a combination of historical materials (collections, primary sources, data sets, editions) and speculative materials (fictions, designs, films, games), and you will compose with a variety of media. Emphasis is placed on prototyping as a form of negotiation and mode of iterative development (Kraus 2009; Drucker and Nowviskie 2007; Rosner 2018). You will be asked to keep a design document or log throughout the course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project in Transformative Prototyping&lt;/strong&gt;: This workshop (or directed study) is an opportunity for you to develop and implement a prototyping project from a previous seminar and examine and even test its social, cultural, and ethical dimensions in the process. It may be conducted in collaboration with a community partner or internship program (where applicable), with advising from a faculty member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of this sequence include, again, flexibility for students, faculty, and staff as well as in the content. The sequence also lends itself to a focus on content and projects, with less emphasis on or assumptions about specific methods (see Digital Methods above). Given its orientation toward theories and concepts, it could morph alongside faculty and student interests, not to mention changes in scholarship. It could also spark experimental approaches to MA and PhD projects, including dissertations, and it could draw heavily on all of the above sequences, but especially the Design and Communication and Social Justice and Transformative Media sequences. It requires a minor to moderate investment in the more technical dimensions of digital humanities, and it could be taught from a low-tech perspective. It may benefit from co-teaching across the disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Things + Boundaries</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making Things and Drawing Boundaries&lt;/em&gt; (2017) is a creative + critical take on “making” in the humanities. The volume communicates alternatives to the popular “maker” brand and movement, and I edited it with the labor and boundaries of making in mind. Its 38 chapters exhibit how humanities projects are patchworks of memory and practice, starting not from scratch but in the middle, with partial and situated knowledge. From there, the book demonstrates how we can take responsibility for the motivations and effects of humanities scholarship as we seek to change or expand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below’s a link to the open access version of &lt;em&gt;Making Things and Drawing Boundaries&lt;/em&gt;, together with an official description of the volume, its table of contents, and author names, abstracts, and links for each of the 38 chapters. The book is available in paperback, library cloth, and ebook formats, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasure to compile and edit this book, and to collaborate with all of its amazing contributors. Nadia Timperio worked with me to prepare the volume and facilitate peer-to-peer review, David Goehring copyedited the volume, and Allison Murphy proofread it with me. Alex Gil, Matt Gold, and Lauren Klein gave valuable feedback on the proposal and manuscript. Eternal thanks to Kari Kraus, Bill Turkel, and Kathy Woodward for their advice early on, and to Carrie Bodle, Axel Roesler, and Phillip Thurtle for teaching with me during the University of Washington’s 2008 Summer Institute in the Arts and Humanities, which inspired the volume. Thanks as well as to everyone at the University of Minnesota Press and Westchester Publishing Services for making the book happen: Douglas Armato, Anne Carter, Danielle M. Kasprzak, Daniel Ochsner, Terence Smyre, and Kenneth Wee at Minnesota, and Susan Baker, Melody Negron, and Maura Neville at Westchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foregrounding the interdisciplinary character of experimental methods and hands-on research, this collection asks what it means to “make” things in the humanities. Comprising almost forty chapters from ninety practitioners across twenty disciplines, &lt;em&gt;Making Things and Drawing Boundaries&lt;/em&gt; speaks directly and extensively to how humanities research engages a growing interest in “maker” culture, however “making” may be defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
I arranged the volume’s 38 chapters into five sections: 1) &lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;“Making and the Humanities,”&lt;/a&gt; 2) &lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;“Made by Whom? For Whom?”&lt;/a&gt;, 3) &lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;“Making as Inquiry,”&lt;/a&gt; 4) &lt;a href=&quot;#4&quot;&gt;“Making Spaces and Interfaces,”&lt;/a&gt; and 5) &lt;a href=&quot;#5&quot;&gt;“Making, Justice, Ethics,”&lt;/a&gt; plus the acknowledgments. The sections include original essays, several pieces republished with revisions, and a number of “project snapshots”: one-page chapters about particular projects to prompt further study and dialogue about making and experimental methods. The differences between the sections and chapters matter, and the contributions are most engaging when read collectively, as a series of negotiations with shared terms and problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/books/mtdbToc2017.pdf&quot;&gt;table of contents&lt;/a&gt;, with titles and authors for all 38 chapters. The chapter abstracts are below, and you can read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/projects/making-things-and-drawing-boundaries&quot;&gt;entire book online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction. “I Don’t Know All The Circuitry,” by Jentery Sayers&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/7d8fca82-c6ca-480f-bf17-1df4a2cdb577#intro&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well I don’t know all the circuitry, but I can do first aid,” said artist Laurie Anderson in October 1981. She was responding to Rob La Frenais, who asked her a few questions about relying on hardware. Arguing that making and scholarship “start in the middle,” this introduction unpacks the implications of Anderson’s statement for research with technologies. It underscores the centrality of maintenance to such research by privileging “conceptual matter,” or the persistent indeterminacies of art, history, language, and culture so vital to the humanities. Drawing on work by Simone Browne, Cornelia Parker, Hannah Perner-Wilson, Karen Barad, and Walter Benjamin, it contextualizes conceptual matter with an emphasis on labor and social relations and then outlines how the chapters collected here complicate demarcations drawn in and beyond the academy: demarcations between thinking and doing, hacking and yacking, writing and building, scholarship and service, creating and critiquing, breaking and repairing, innovation and maintenance, and making and not making, for instance. The introduction concludes with a few notes on the importance of modest negotiations with materials premised on a balance of skepticism with surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Making and the Humanities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This section addresses foundational issues about how boundaries are drawn between thinking and doing (Klein) as well as how creative work manifests in humanities contexts, and vice versa (Staley). Entwined with these issues are key matters of literacy (Endres), or how much making, writing, building, coding, digitizing, and fabricating intersect despite common cuts between them. Equally important to this section are the embodied acts of translation and framing we perform in our research and how those acts are imbricated with maintenance across technical and non-technical work (Sneha). The projects features in this section also represent compelling collaborations between artists, humanists, and designers (Rajko et al.), where acts of making are collective (not individuated) and give us a tangible sense of how cultural criticism is enacted through experiments with circuits and interfaces (Burgess).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 1.  “The Boundary Work of Making in Digital Humanities,” by Julie Thompson Klein&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/4f752a6d-e916-4dfa-b1d3-b873df744a17#ch01&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debates on digital humanities are sites of boundary work in a history of arguments about the nature of the field. The advent of digital technologies in humanities was the catalyst for two kinds of boundary work: protecting traditional modes of scholarship and teaching from the encroachment of new approaches that bridge the traditional border separating humanities from technology and asserting the priority of some practices over others. Framed against the historical backdrop of dichotomies of thinking versus doing, this chapter tracks the evolving discourse of “making” in arguments and activities that have reconceptualized building tools as a reductive mechanical production to an intellectual endeavor with its own professional practices, standards, and theory. It aligns reconceptualization of their relationship with naming practices in the emergent field and its expanding scope framed by Patrik Svensson’s typology of five paradigmatic modes of engagement: as a tool, a study object, an expressive medium, an experimental laboratory, and an activist venue. It then identifies intellectual warrants for making in the concept of thinking-through-practice being elaborated in a new epistemology, aesthetics, and rhetoric of building, amplified by work associated with a new materiality of things, critical making, and the concept of critically-infused reflection about process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 2.  “On the ‘Maker Turn’ in the Humanities,” by David Staley&lt;/em&gt;  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/be0ac4f2-f18b-476e-9199-463df64aa8d9#ch02&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to read humanities Big Data has necessitated new forms of reading, new types of interpretation. Often, the most effective way to draw meaning from large data sets is through visualizations and the knowing that comes from the perception of visual pattern and form. Humanists might use digital fabrication tools as a way to build three-dimensional visual forms. That is, humanists may sculpt into material form the visual patterns of humanistic texts. The resulting objects are (non-textual) evidence of our reading. If the goal of the humanist’s reading/interpretation of texts is to unlock meaning, then one approach to making in the humanities might involve creating physical objects as an interpretive act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 3.  “Vibrant Lives Presents&lt;/em&gt; The Living Net,” &lt;em&gt;by Jessica Rajko (research, textile work), Jacqueline Wernimont (research, textile work), Eileen Standley (research), Stjepan Rajko (software design), and Michael Krzyzaniak (software design)&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/1eed3831-c441-471a-9ab4-3a70afafddb5#ch03&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Living Net&lt;/em&gt; is one of several techno-textile projects created by the Vibrant Lives team. Using our Vibrant Lives app, we transform the network activity—or “data shed”—of event participants into a sound file that then plays through sub-sonic subwoofers, thereby causing the &lt;em&gt;Living Net&lt;/em&gt; to vibrate at a variable rate depending on the amount of data being shed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 4.  “A Literacy of Building: Making in the Digital Humanities,” by Bill Endres&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/2acf33b9-ac0f-4411-8e8f-552bb711e87c#ch04&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the humanities, the most contentious issue generated by DH is not about digital methods or the value of digitally generated knowledge; instead, it is about recognizing making as scholarly activity. In these debates, proponents of print-based scholarship view making as inferior to writing, their gold standard for scholarly activity. The conditioning of academe by a longstanding reliance on print encourages these scholars to view activities related to computer science as skills. Ironically, in the recent past such a reductive view limited scholarship in another area: literacy. For a prolonged time, literacy was viewed as a set of skills rather than as ideologically constructed social activity. Once this perception changed, scholars were able to ask new questions that revolutionized the understanding of literacy. This chapter examines how scholarly making in DH is not a set of isolated “skills” but instead ideologically constructed social activity. It argues against the counterproductive pitting of writing against making and for comprehending the shared ideological constructs of the two, constructs that make both writing and making dynamic cultural forces for generating and expressing what can be known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 5. “MashBOT,” by Helen J. Burgess&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/e913f0ff-4a13-4f08-a164-7945f43a8636#ch05&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MashBOT consists of a small thermal receipt printer connected to Twitter via an Arduino microcontroller. Love notes are generated using Markov chains from a corpus consisting of ninety lines from Roland Barthes’s &lt;em&gt;A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments&lt;/em&gt; and ten from Bruno Latour’s &lt;em&gt;Aramis: or the Love of Technology&lt;/em&gt;, published to the @mashomatic Twitter account and printed as “receipts” for display. MashBOT asks us to think about the ways in which the written declaration of love (the “mash note”) is a document at once transactional and unfathomable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 6. “Making Humanities in the Digital: Embodiment and Framing in&lt;/em&gt; Bichitra &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Indiancine.ma,” &lt;em&gt;by P.P. Sneha&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/6f09fce0-3734-4f2c-b13c-f8981d3db2bd#ch06&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explores the processes of “making” digital objects in the context of recent humanities research in India that mobilizes digital techniques as key methods. This research includes an online video archive (Indiancine.ma) and a digital variorum of Rabindranath Tagore’s literary works (Bichitra) developed at the University of Jadavpur, Kolkata. Film, text, and archival objects acquire several nuances as they are made into digital objects, and these are reflected in methods of working with and studying them. Through a discussion of these projects, and drawing on literature on embodiment, affect, and representation in the digital, the chapter extends the above thoughts on making by suggesting that: (a) the processes of making digital objects are creative &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; analytical, affective, and embodied, and (b) the “digital” itself is in a perpetual state of change and collapses different processes of making into one, namely that of “framing” information. The chapter draws largely from interviews with researchers and practitioners working with these and similar initiatives, conducted as part of a study on mapping the field of digital humanities in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. Made By Whom? For Whom?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
This section stresses what is routinely taken for granted in popular maker cultures: who is working, for whom, and under what assumptions about labor and power. Here we have questions about how collaboration and agency are articulated across ranks in the academy (Jenstad and Takeda), together with inquiries into how the academy is made and reproduced, often through affective labor that parses scholarship from service (Shirazi). Service and scholarship are interwoven even further when we consider how digital materials are maintained post-production (Gardner et al.), not to mention how research environments are built, with what resources, and through which dependencies (Smithies). Of course, we must also ask how “makers” get defined in the first place (Hunter et al.; O’Gorman), and in what relation to normalcy and ability (Hendren). Projects in this section parody popular maker cultures (Hertz) as they expose the longstanding alliance of technologies with force and surveillance (Burtch and Rosenthal). Ultimately, this section resists celebratory or romantic models of making to instead examine how technologies—as negotiations—correspond with agency and vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 7. “Making the RA Matter: Pedagogy, Interface, and Practices,” by Janelle Jenstad and Joseph Takeda&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/97aabf63-0679-47e1-b3e4-5abca1dc5d9e#ch07&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Map of Early Modern London&lt;/em&gt; (MoEML) is a SSHRC-funded digital-humanities project that has had over 30 student research assistants (RAs) since 1999. In his or her tenure with MoEML, each student gains new skillsets and abilities that allow the site to be remade in ways the project director could never expect. Project Director Jenstad and RA/Junior Programmer Takeda, articulate the benefits of a pedagogical model that positions the paid RA as interface between the project leaders and the project goals and desired outcomes. In considering the RA as an active member of the project team and not simply as the “invisible hands” who encode the project, MoEML also becomes a pedagogical space, which allows RAs to learn in ways that exceed the purview of the prescribed learning outcomes in grant applications and to contribute to the site in important ways. Drawing on bell hooks’s theories of liberatory pedagogy and Wendy Chun and Johanna Drucker’s recent work on interfaces, this chapter emphasizes the pedagogical potential of thinking of the RA as interface and allowing the team to make and remake itself in ways that work for the project and personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 8. “Reproducing the Academy: Librarians and the Question of Service in the Digital Humanities,” by Roxanne Shirazi&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/544313f1-eec6-4c2b-8988-62ed898ec288#ch08&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who draws the line between service and scholarship? This chapter places the concepts of emotion work and reproductive labor in conversation with librarianship as a feminized profession to expose the challenges encountered by academic librarians undertaking collaborative work in the digital humanities. Librarians contributing to digital humanities projects face the dual hurdle of breaking through gendered professional assumptions and dealing with the deep credentialism found within academia. Along with women, people of color, and queer scholars who disproportionately shoulder the burden of committee work and community building among faculty in the disciplines, librarians perform vital intellectual labor that reproduces the academy but too often gets devalued as “service work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 9. “Looks Like We Made It, But Are We Sustaining Digital Scholarship?” by Chelsea A. M. Gardner, Gwynaeth McIntyre, Kaitlyn Solberg, and Lisa Tweten&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/fabe2b5d-8697-49db-9291-eae3e0b4281e#ch09&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing number of digital projects relating to the field of antiquity is especially promising for the future of traditionally archaic academic fields, including Ancient History, Classics, and Archaeology. However, it is not enough to embark upon a digital humanities project simply for the sake of having a digital presence. To make digital humanities projects truly meaningful, students and professionals must ensure that their contributions are useful and relevant. As a case study, this article presents how a small scale digitization project entitled “From Stone to Screen” approaches the “Three R’s” for creating sustainable DH projects: Research, Relevance, and Replicability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 10. “Full Stack DH: Building a Virtual Research Environment on a Raspberry Pi,” by James Smithies&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/859c8bb8-df9d-46e9-8372-334bbbb71926#ch10&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimal computing offers interesting ways for humanists to engage with maker culture and better understand their relationship to technical devices. Experimenting with minimal computers helps us learn new skills and understand the nature of digital technology, but it also allows us to operationalize the “return to things” advocated by writers like Ian Hodder and explore notions of entanglement discussed by philosophers of science and technology like Donald Ihde. This project migrated a personal scholarly blog from wordpress.org to a minimal Raspberry Pi computer, using the process as an experiment in postphenomenology and the end product as a prototype for a Virtual Research Environment (VRE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 11. “Mic Jammer,” by Allison Burtch and Eric Rosenthal&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/f8dcc03c-2bc3-499a-8c1b-1d17f4098400#ch11&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mic Jammer is an ultrasonic security system that gives people the confidence to know that their smart phones are non-invasively muted. When it is pointed at a smart phone, it de-senses the phone’s microphone by applying a very high-level, ultrasonic signal inaudible to humans but not to technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 12. “The Making of a Digital Humanities Neo-Luddite,” by Marcel O’Gorman&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/720a563d-f5c3-4090-8d4f-d84452efd916#ch12&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original Luddites were not anti-technological; they were critical of technologies that threatened their livelihoods and automated their handiwork, much of which involved skillful technics. In the same way, humanities scholars who have no interest in xml encoding or visualization are not anti-technological; they may simply be satisfied with the technics at their disposal, much of which makes use of digital tools like word processing software and databases. What’s more, many humanities scholars view the screen-based work of “DH building” as complicit with the prevailing technoculture that threatens their livelihoods. This chapter takes a neo-Luddite approach to DH, suggesting that humanities scholars can engage critically with technoculture, not by building screen-based tools for other humanities scholars, but by making “objects-to-think-with” that question technological impacts on society and the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 13. “Made: Technology on Affluent Leisure Time,” by Garnet Hertz&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/99b20079-6a78-43bc-8110-3804b04acc65#ch13&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sticker was produced as a parody and critique of Make Magazine by O’Reilly Media. It was distributed for free and included as an insert in the first edition of &lt;em&gt;Critical Making&lt;/em&gt; (Hollywood, Cal.: Telharmonium Press. 2012).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 14. “Reifying the Maker as Humanist,” by John Hunter, Katherine Faull, and Diane Jakacki&lt;/em&gt;  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/6ea34bdc-68a3-4b3b-bdd3-d383f4b6ff4a#ch14&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter argues that the success of “making” depends not only on physical space, but rather on the intersections between disciplines that encourage critical humanistic discourse. Rather than reifying the digital humanities maker as a (usually male, usually white, usually economically and socially advantaged) creator, we argue that the DH makers are uniquely positioned to subvert paradigms of class, race, and gender and ableist privilege. We further assert that as (digital) humanists, we (with our students) have an opportunity and a responsibility to reclaim the importance of making as being historically central to the humanities. After first undoing the presumed discontinuity between traditional humanist practice and contemporary DH makers, we move on to some specific examples from our own experience and end by articulating the transformative potential of the DH maker as an enactment of humanistic thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 15. “All Technology Is Assistive: Six Design Rules on Disability,” by Sara Hendren&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/b22b7f2d-f386-4ec5-bcee-30591c0078ba#ch15&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So-called assistive technologies have for at least the last 75 years been researched and developed in many cultures under the paradigm of “Rehabilitation Engineering”—tools and devices intended to restore normalcy to atypical bodies and minds. But what might critical disability studies have to say about the design, distribution, and use of these technologies? And might an expanded, supple sense of assistance radically alter the design of these tools? Finally, what else might prosthetics do in an expressive, performative sense to reframe normalcy in the body?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. Making as Inquiry&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
This section stresses making as an action, which involves developing, prototyping, testing, and sharing conceptual matter. (For a definition of conceptual matter, see the introduction.) Central to such inquiry is the communicability of experimental research as both process and product to audiences other than academics (Resch et al.), how we might prototype across print and electronic materials (Hancock et al.), and how hacking and reverse engineering technologies (Boeva et al.; Teboul) immerse us in indeterminacies against kit-of-parts construction. In this section, we see numerous creative/critical approaches to technologies, both new and old. Curation becomes a creative act (Bernardi and Dimmock), circuit bending becomes a technique for interface and console design (Belojevic), poems become 3-D models (Tucker et al.), and poetry readings become disembodied audio and then re-embodied performances (Flamenco et al.). Each of these inquiries stewards materials across settings and contexts and prompts us to consider how matter and mediation influence our conversations with the past (Garfinkel). While we can get carried away by the wow factor of gadgets, this section reminds us to pause and, if only in vain, try to arrest the fragments of history against the predictability of positivism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 16. “Thinking as Handwork: Critical Making with Humanistic Concerns,” by Gabby Resch, Dan Southwick, Isaac Record, and Matt Ratto&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/4b5fd8b4-2a39-4d7a-a563-3e611da220f0#ch16&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we describe some ways of thinking productively about materiality by illustrating how our own material interventions have troubled theoretical work (and vice versa). We discuss methods of inquiry inspired by critical making, particularly in work that engages with cultural institutions like galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. We elaborate on recent experiences our lab has had building and deploying objects and experiences, most of which use 3-D printing as a medium, in a handful of world-class museums. Through this, we hope to enrich conversations around how scientific and cultural knowledge are often co-produced; how infrastructures that cross disciplinary boundaries can share objects, methods, and features; and how new technologies that blur material­-digital distinctions are changing cultural institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 17. “Bibliocircuitry and the Design of the Alien Everyday, 2012-13,” by Charity Hancock, Clifford Hichar, Carlea Holl-Jensen, Kari Kraus, Cameron Mozafari, and Kathryn Skutlin&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/7b83c1a0-8e49-404f-9023-bfdc5c6874e2#ch17&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bibliocircuitry and the Design of the Alien Everyday is a series of student projects that grew out of several book design labs conducted as part of a Fall 2012 course (ENGL 758B Book 2.0: The History of the Book and the Future of Reading) taught by Kari Kraus at the University of Maryland. Using physical books as springboards for computation and mixed media experiments, the student projects realize one of the larger aims of the course: to position bibliotextual scholarship and pedagogy as design-oriented practices that can be used to prototype and imagine the future of the book. The project resulted in a publication by the same name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 18. “Doing History by Reverse Engineering Electronic Devices,” by Yana Boeva, Devon Elliott, Edward Jones-Imhotep, Shezan Muhammedi, and William J. Turkel&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/27e9987f-0111-4b3a-9a0a-1df104a819d4#ch18&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We describe three experiences with a rewarding, but still relatively underutilized, form of collaborative historical practice: reverse engineering electronic artifacts. Our first case study involves the recreation of wireless effects designed by early-20th-century magicians to simulate mind reading. These effects depended on electromagnetic induction, a technique which has recently come to prominence for its applications in RFID, NFC, wireless charging, and secure wireless communications, largely driven by interest in the Internet of Things. Our second case study is a software recreation–using a visual programming language–of an analog electronic musical instrument built by the Canadian pioneer Hugh Le Caine. Our third case study is an analog electronic computer. Long dismissed as a technology that was an also-ran to digital electronic computation (and we think unfairly so), analog electronic computing played a fundamental role in the history of engineering and of scientific instrumentation and continues to be a crucial electronic technology in today’s devices. Using these three cases, we show that things (re)made can serve as productive, interdisciplinary sites of research creation in the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 19. “Electronic Music Hardware and Open Design Methodologies for Post-Optimal Objects,” by Ezra Teboul&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/bcbaf93f-c2a5-4bb1-85f5-13da2c749b90#ch19&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter presents a short overview of hardware hacking practices in electronic music, suggesting how component level analysis of some artifacts can inform the musical products and their environments. How do evolutions within the field inform discussions of larger cultural trends? In order to address this and related questions, the concept of post-optimal electronics is adapted to audio technologies. Examples show how different degrees and understandings of freedom in this practice lead inventors to develop personal, fragmented and multi-faceted understandings of engineering, based in experimentation rather than prediction. The document ends by suggesting points for future analysis, contextualization, and invention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 20. “Glitch Console,” by Nina Belojevic&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/b1dbaeab-f4ad-4738-9064-8ea740289503#ch20&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belojevic’s “glitch console”—a modified Nintendo Entertainment System—demonstrates how circuit bending engages with the materiality of videogames and game consoles, linking such consumer products to issues of labor, environment, and industry exploitation. Circuit bending, the practice of modifying the behavior of electronics by soldering new connection points on a circuit board, also encourages a creative, hands-on approach to media studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 21. “Creative Curating: The Digital Archive as Argument,” by Joanne Bernardi and Nora Dimmock&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/d25ff116-befe-484c-8460-c372bf25998c#ch21&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re-envisioning Japan: Japan as Destination in 20th Century Visual and Material Culture&lt;/em&gt; (REJ) is an ongoing faculty-Digital Humanities Center project that models humanistic scholarship realized and communicated through creative curation and a collaboratively built digital environment. REJ encompasses both a digital archive and a material collection of tourism, travel, and educational ephemera in a wide range of media, documenting changing representations of Japan and its place in the world in the early-to-mid-20th century. This chapter traces REJ’s five-year development from the prospect of a scholarly monograph with a digital component to a collaborative project that functions as critical humanities scholarship. The process of re-imagining contexts of the past by connecting objects in relevant and meaningful ways has been key to REJ’s development as object-driven research: instead of using the objects and images in the REJ collection to illustrate pre-existing narratives, the REJ digital archive has evolved from questions and lines of investigation derived from the images and objects themselves, exposing the scholarship inherent in the curatorial process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 22. “Reading Series Matter: Performing the SpokenWeb Project,” by Lee Hannigan, Aurelio Meza, and Alexander Flamenco&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/d29c51e4-fa81-4535-89aa-2d8c7dd66b02#ch22&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past twenty or so years, a large number of poetry sound recordings have been collected and stored in online databases hosted by university institutions. The SpokenWeb digital archive is one such collection. Housed at Concordia University, SpokenWeb features over 89 sound recordings from a poetry reading series that took place at Sir George Williams University (now Concordia) between 1966 and 1974. In the early 2000s, the original reel-to-reel tapes were converted to mp3, and by 2010 the SpokenWeb project, using the SGWU Poetry Series as a case study, was well into its exploration for ways to engage with poetry’s sound recordings as an object of literary analysis. As a coherent (if partial) unit of study, SpokenWeb, or the recorded reading series in general, allows us to return (if artificially) to an ephemeral live event, see beyond the archived document, and interpret it as an aggregate, one that is historically, technologically, and culturally specific. But how exactly do we approach this aggregate? How is history made through the (re)construction of artifacts, and how is this kind of making playing a role in humanities research?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 23. “Loss Sets,” by Aaron Tucker, Jordan Scott, Tiffany Cheung, and Namir Ahmed&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/295ebba3-f963-4be4-b9c7-ad8ea90062f9#ch23&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with Ryerson University’s Digital Media Experience Lab, the Ryerson Geospatial Maps and Data Centre, and the Ryerson Centre for Digital Humanities, the 3-D Poetry Project translates poems co-written by Jordan Scott and Aaron Tucker into sculptures. The poems are first turned into coordinates along the X, Y, and Z axes, after which (under Tucker, Namir Ahmed and Tiffany Cheung’s direction) those points are imported into the 3-D modeling software, Rhino, where the models are rendered with the Grasshopper plugin. The pieces are further manipulated using information such as latitude, longitude, and spot height from the Columbia Icefields. The poems are originally generated under the theme of “loss,” and the icefield data is incorporated with that theme to resist and/or examine the often utopian impulses around 3-D printing “replacing” any object, especially as technologization relates to the natural world. Using these multiple data sets, a sculpture is “carved away” from a six-inch cube, and those results are then printed using a 3-D printer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 24. “Dialogic Objects in the Age of 3-D Printing: The Case of the Lincoln Life Mask,” by Susan Garfinkel&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/a7eff40f-41f9-4851-9d9a-d560888c4dda#ch24&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 2013 saw the launch of “Smithsonian X 3D,” an initiative to scan significant museum artifacts and turn them into 3-D digital models to view online or download and 3-D-print via a portal website. Among the most intriguing of the models to appear on the site is the 1865 Abraham Lincoln life mask, which powerfully retains a sense of presence through its multiple transformations. Starting from the work of critic Mikhail Bakhtin in &lt;em&gt;The Dialogic Imagination&lt;/em&gt; and the body of material culture scholarship, this paper explores the nature of the dialogic object as foregrounded by the uses and implications of 3-D-printed copies of cultural artifacts such as the Lincoln life mask. If objects are things in context–physical, cultural, historical, aesthetic–then the 3-D print’s trajectory from original artifact to 3-D model to printed copy at once complicates and clarifies the shifting terrains, both physical and meaningful, that all material entities inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV. Making Spaces and Interfaces&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
This section shares several perspectives on how what appears ephemeral or immaterial is framed and designed. It also stresses the settings and values of making. Foregrounding the straight, white, cis-gender masculinity pervading maker cultures and makerspaces, we see arguments for feminist hackerspaces (Burek et al.) and interdisciplinary makerspaces informed by queer feminisms (Rogers), combined with feminist approaches to wearable technologies and public humanities research (Knight et al.). We also encounter mobile projects invested in the politics of technologies and social relations (Hsu et al.; Martin et al.) as well as in the values of intelligent devices and smart cities (DiSalvo et al.). These projects underscore how important design and intersection are to persuasive work with technologies. Experience design, participatory design, applied cultural criticism, public interactives, and networked acts of witnessing all play a fundamental role in this section (Ruecker and Roberts-Smith; Balsamo et al.; Cooley and Buell; Knochel and Papaelias). These shared investments show how interfaces are not merely tools for re-presentation or copying; they are interpretations, and indeterminacy may very well be their primary ingredient (Sullivan et al.). Even when interfaces are steeped in machine knowledge and computer processing, their significance exceeds the circuits through which they are transmitted, and the conceptual matter that emerges with them is far more interesting than their tech specs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 25. “Feminist Hackerspaces: Hacking Culture, Not Devices (the zine!),” by Amy Burek, Emily Alden Foster, Sarah Fox, and Daniela K. Rosner&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/633d5ff2-d3c4-4345-b7fe-048155e28493#ch25&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Fox, Ulgado and Rosner published an academic paper on a study of feminist hackerspaces in 2015, a chance encounter between Burek, a hackerspace member, and Fox at a local short run publication festival led to collaboration on a zine–a self-published magazine typically made with a photocopier–that knit together content from the published paper with local histories of feminist print production. Reprinted here, the zine is an effort circulate scholarship and continue conversations from the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 26. “Fashioning Circuits (2011-Present),” by Kim A. Brillante Knight (founder and director); Brianni Nelson, Elisa Pequini, Amy Pickup, Tameka Reeves, and Mattie Tanner (co-founding students); Elizabeth Bell, Jessica Knott, Jodi Madera-Prado, Andrew Miller, Laura Pasquini, and Lari Tanner (research team); B Cavello, Sunnye Childers, Lance King, Harrison Massey, Patti Mcletchie, Sydnie Montgomery, Karla Muñoz, and Lauren Shafer (community team)&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/05613b02-ec93-4588-98e0-36cd4336e7a0#ch26&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fashioning Circuits uses wearable media as a lens to consider the social and cultural valences of bodies and identities in relation to fashion, technology, labor practices, and craft and maker cultures. A public humanities project, it combines scholarship, university coursework, and community partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 27. “Making Queer Feminisms Matter: A Transdisciplinary Makerspace for the Rest of Us,” by Melissa Rogers&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/0a57c406-9b52-4251-ac55-ecc7af2db513#ch27&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter offers a snapshot of the Women’s Studies Multimedia Studio at the University of Maryland, a transdisciplinary space for the exploration of the politics of making in the humanities and a laboratory for the prototyping of feminist pedagogies. Through Interactive Textiles, an experimental workshop series focusing on the practice of fiber crafts such as knitting and crochet, I demonstrate how queer feminist cultural production in spaces like the Multimedia Studio can transform our understandings of “the digital” and challenge our assumptions about what counts as creativity. Doing so might enable us to imagine multiple futures for digital humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 28. “Movable Party,” by Wendy Hsu, Steven Kemper, Josef Cameron Taylor, Linda Wei, and Jacob Alden Sargent&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/ea0628cc-350a-4ffa-bb25-0332c4ef7a88#ch28&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movable Party is a bicycle-powered system for participatory mobile musical performance designed and built by Los-Angeles-based maker collective, Movable Parts. Taking design inspirations from Taiwan’s street sound innovations, the collective made the system to instigate ad hoc, emplaced social interactions as a form of creative friction against the urban sprawl. The system consists of three stationary bicycles, each equipped with rear wheel hub motors that generate enough energy to power a medium-sized public address system. The bicycles are also equipped with sensors to track rear wheel speed as well as rider position. Mapped to musical parameters in software, sensor data from riders’ gestures and movements transform the bicycles into interactive musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 29. “Disrupting Dichotomies: Mobilizing Digital Humanities with the MakerBus,” by Kim Martin, Beth Compton, and Ryan Hunt&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/2256896b-9de5-478f-90b3-44d85e494483#ch29&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past two years has seen the emergence of mobile spaces, whether for maker exploration, art displays, transporting classrooms, or providing access to technology. As co-founders of the MakerBus, a mobile makerspace aimed at increasing digital literacy and promoting engagement with local cultural heritage, the authors know first-hand the importance of mobility, and the successes and difficulties that come along with it. This chapter explores various perceived dichotomies that exist at the point where the maker movement meets academia. Through our unique point of view as humanities practitioners overseeing the MakerBus project, we offer a reflexive take on three main dichotomies that highlight both the practical limitations and theoretical implications of: the role we play as producers and consumers of both maker material and heritage and humanities content; our experiences trying to bridge academia and the community, shifting the locus of humanities research from the campus to the wider public, and breaking down the role of the expert; and the limits of our ability to provide universal access to technology and a critical awareness of our newfound roles as gatekeepers on a multitude of levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 30. “Designs for Foraging: Fruit Are Heavy,” by Carl DiSalvo, Tom Jenkins, Jong Won (Karl) Kim, Catherine Meschia, and Craig Durkin&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/72a6c541-e5d8-4952-ba53-791a5e9f24f3#ch30&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Design for Foraging project explores the appropriation of precision technologies for ad-hoc urban agricultures. Fruit Are Heavy is a custom-designed, low-fidelity sensing platform to infer the ripeness of fruit in trees by monitoring the relative droop of branches as the fruit matures. The project uses research-thru-design to speculate on diverse economies and propose alternative configurations of so-called smart cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 31. “Experience Design for the Humanities: Activating Multiple Interpretations,” by Stan Ruecker and Jennifer Roberts-Smith&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/fc008ab5-502a-4073-8624-fb24ba243dbc#ch31&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter argues that the humanities has an opportunity to create a new kind of experience design that is fundamentally different in its goals from experience design in industry. The underlying premise is that there are forms of activation resulting from cultural experiences that range from the immediate physiological reaction to the long-term creative response. The word “activation” refers here to the various physical and psychological states of response to a stimulus. Our own goal for this practice is therefore to explore new ways of designing experiences to engage audiences in complex acts of interpretation, as they move into and out from cultural performances and venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 32. “&lt;/em&gt;AIDS Quilt Touch&lt;em&gt;: Virtual Quilt Browser,” by Anne Balsamo, Dale MacDonald, and Jon Winet&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/acee4e20-acf5-4eb3-bb98-0ebaa5c10aaa#ch32&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;AIDS Quilt Touch&lt;/em&gt; (AQT) Virtual Quilt Browser is one of several interactive experiences based on the AIDS Memorial Quilt. In free-browse mode, viewers can explore the Quilt by zooming and panning across the 25 gigapixel image. In the narrative threads mode, viewers can follow pathways that present stories about individual panels and the cultural significance of the Quilt. Other AQT applications include a story-making platform, a digital guest book, and interactive timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 33. “Building Humanities Software that Matters: The Case of&lt;/em&gt; Ward One &lt;em&gt;Mobile App,” by Heidi Rae Cooley and Duncan A. Buell&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/b5fa825d-0c78-493a-8313-b59337358c65#ch33&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past four years, we have been developing critical interactives that bring unacknowledged histories of social inequity to visibility. Our current project is a mobile application for iPhone called &lt;em&gt;Ward One&lt;/em&gt; that foregrounds the history of urban renewal that made possible the expansion of the University of South Carolina at the expense of working class African Americans. In this chapter, we focus on the software that makes the app an operational and nontrivial critical interactive. We discuss the structural logic of the content management system and the micro-processes that “push” (not “pull”) content to the touchscreen interface, how tracking location histories and dwell time affords personalization of experience at the machine level, and preference and “like” features that allow interactors to tailor their own experiences. We also discuss how guided and unguided learning software extract particular features to create individualized experiences. Ultimately, we show how everyday technological processes that run unnoticed in the background, tracking and keeping track of us, might very well produce the conditions for meaningful sociocultural change in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 34. “Placeable: A Social Practice for Place-based Learning and Co-design Paradigms,” by Aaron D. Knochel and Amy Papaelias&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/1b5cf7ca-679e-4b51-8fec-dfbb4c5de167#ch34&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placeable is a place-based curricular approach that explores how social practice interfaces with design strategies for interactive media in undergraduate studio and digital research courses. Our chapter reviews the progression of placeable curriculum developed over several semesters as a collaboration between art education and design faculty. Placeable is based on three core constructs: seeking place­-based knowledge to incorporate community assets that are relevant to the arts and humanities; using connective mobile making to allow for on­site rich media production; and employing co-design strategies to engage in critical intervention. Placeable project work activates interaction design, qualitative research methods and community asset mapping to innovate intersections between arts and humanities scholarship and making practices. We offer insights into the complexities of social practice and higher education as co-design paradigms in the context of broader critical making inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 35. “Making the Model: Scholarship and Rhetoric in 3-D Historical Reconstructions,” by Elaine Sullivan, Angel David Nieves, and Lisa M. Snyder&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/d441edf8-4e56-4721-a3f4-0a9a1674c15f#ch35&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars investigating the impact of the built landscape on historic communities are increasingly turning to the creation of 3-D computer models to reconstruct aspects of now-disappeared or altered sites. These models are frequently dismissed by humanities scholars as simple representations or illustrations and not a form of research scholarship. We argue that the making of a 3-D reconstruction model asks scholars to perform the same processes as traditional research, with the difference that the final product is an interactive environment with an emphasis on the visual, as opposed to the written word. To design a successful research project that incorporates 3-D content, the scholar must identify a question that is best (or sometimes can only be) answered by considering space and spatial relationships. The resulting model is not a neutral representation of “the past,” but the scholar’s interpretation of &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; aspects of a place at a certain time–an interpretation that can be challenged, revised, or rejected by others. Using case studies from across historical time and space (ancient Egypt; Chicago 1893; 20th-century South Africa), this chapter demonstrates how “making” a model can be a rich form of critical scholarly practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V. Making, Ethics, Justice&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
This section focuses on issues of labor, equity, intersectionality, and material conditions that run throughout the book. We are prompted to move beyond the “gendered, capitalist benefits of being a person who makes products” and “celebrate and foster education, maintenance, analysis, critique, and, above all, caregiving—all of the undervalued, underappreciated, ongoing work of making other people’s lives better” (Chachra). We are also given several examples of how social justice may inform project design and development in humanities labs (Boggs et al.). And we conclude with a thought-provoking consideration of how we define “we” through material practice (Anderson and Campbell). So crucial to a digital humanities of the present moment, this final section offers us some language as well as a few paradigms for work that is aware of the boundaries it draws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 36. “Beyond Making,” by Debbie Chachra&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/daed12ff-5373-41a2-8b19-8438ab0004cf#ch36&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Making” has historically been made possible by an enormous amount of labor that does not result in artifacts, such as caregiving and education, work which is often invisible, gendered, and poorly-compensated or unpaid. This short chapter argues against the devaluation of these types of labor as a byproduct of an emphasis on “making.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 37. “Making It Matter,” by Jeremy Boggs, Jennifer Reed, and J. K. Purdom Lindblad&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/f29e68c9-e28e-4c1a-b083-93025a5ed6b3#ch37&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For making to matter in the humanities, making should demonstrate that the people involved matter. This chapter encourages an ethos of making that encourages attention to–and advocacy for–the humane. Regardless of whether the act of making is one of production, praxis, theory, or a combination of the three, thoughtful making in the humanities should forefront reflection on human experiences and impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 38. “Ethics in the Making,” by Erin R. Anderson and Trisha N. Campbell&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-aa1769f2-6c55-485a-81af-ea82cce86966/section/2bac4a0c-e91c-4873-801c-c113190700fb#ch38&quot;&gt;open access&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking up on calls for an “ethical turn” in digital humanities, we consider how digital artists and composers might attune ourselves toward the ethical potential of our own encounters with the media and materials of our practice. While others have suggested the potential for works of digital art to affect or move audiences toward new ethical ends, we seek to push the conversation to consider the act of making itself. Grounding our argument in our own practice-based digital methods, we discuss two projects that use performative and disruptive approaches to digital audio in order to make, speak, and feel &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the voices of others–the voices of accused murderers (“Call Me a Murderer,” Campbell) and the voices of the dead (“Our Time Is Up,” Anderson). By considering our sensory and affective relationships to the production of these works, we propose a model of &lt;em&gt;posthuman empathy&lt;/em&gt;, which invites us to confront complex ethical entanglements of selves and others, humans and machines, living and dead. Ultimately, we argue that intentional compositional engagement with digital media and methods might provide us with a powerful opportunity to account for a fuller range of our ethical relations with the social-material world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Minimal Definitions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In May 2015, Alex Gil wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/&quot;&gt;compelling piece&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/&quot;&gt;GO::DH Minimal Computing Group&lt;/a&gt; on minimal computing and “producing our own scholarship ourselves.” There, he made the following remark, “I prefer to approach minimal computing around the question ‘What do we need?’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I want to follow Gil’s piece by outlining my own, admittedly unpolished observations on the topic. The emerging definitions of minimal computing and its frameworks fascinate me, in part because they engage various histories of technology at the intersection of aesthetics and politics. They also help us grasp possibilities for future work. While what’s below warrants more detail and thus more complexity, I hope it at least continues the conversation Gil so graciously began over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what might we mean when we say, “minimal computing”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-design&quot;&gt;Minimal Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-use&quot;&gt;Minimal Use&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-consumption&quot;&gt;Minimal Consumption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-maintenance&quot;&gt;Minimal Maintenance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-barriers&quot;&gt;Minimal Barriers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-internet&quot;&gt;Minimal Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-externals&quot;&gt;Minimal Externals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-automation&quot;&gt;Minimal Automation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-space&quot;&gt;Minimal Space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-technical-language&quot;&gt;Minimal Technical Language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimal-&quot;&gt;Minimal …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;References&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-design&quot;&gt;Minimal Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, minimal computing immediately suggests minimal design, especially as it pertains to workflow and communication. Following the Unix philosophy of DOTADIW (“Do One Thing and Do It Well”), minimal design applauds and even fetishizes simplicity; it boils practice down to necessities. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll site generator&lt;/a&gt; is an obvious example: “No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install—just your &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;.” From a technical perspective, this design strategy entails responsiveness across devices, optimization, few dependencies, and an investment in plain text, unembellished layouts, and basic templates. Changes to the style and structure of a project should be few and far between. Both conceptually and practically, design should be in the background; it should not be pronounced or assertive. Sites and software should not be feature-rich, either. While a given project may require some programming (e.g., in Ruby), technical details and configurations are rendered less significant than the message or substance of composition: “just your &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue with minimal design is its vexed relationship with legacies of elegance in programming (e.g., pure function, no unnecessary code, or desugaring a language) as well as the pretentiousness of some minimalist design (e.g., refinement through the use of essential elements). Even if minimal design is mostly about reducing forward, bold, or resource-heavy design, related legacies of elegance and minimalism typically aestheticize politics through a mastery of form, content, and even matter. To remove excess components or use only essential elements is to define, often implicitly, what and for whom “excess” and “essential” mean in the first place. In calls for minimal design, we might therefore ask where the mess is, how content becomes “just content,” and what sort of expertise and decision-making minimization assumes. It is often important, for example, to share the mess of development with others, and minimalist aesthetics may all too easily afford an impression that everything has been polished or refined from the start (e.g., a form outside of history or an idea from the heavens), even when the source files are available (e.g., via GitHub).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is the tendency of minimal design to parse content from media instead of underscoring the palpable reality of their contingencies. Theoretically speaking, this split is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain. Unless we resort to idealism, I’m not sure how we can even imagine content or media in a vacuum. Yet, in practice, the labor of computing and new media are often divided along these lines, with values ascribed to those divisions (e.g., programming is a service that supports writing, or writing is a service with programming as its source). Thus, a more persuasive approach may be refusing notions of pure content, pure medium, or pure design to then examine their entanglements (e.g., writing through programming, or programming as writing). Among recent publications, W.J.T. Mitchell’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/1771&quot;&gt;“Addressing Media”&lt;/a&gt; (2008) points us in this direction, and various practitioners, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elizabethlapensee.com/&quot;&gt;Elizabeth LaPensée&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://markcmarino.com/wordpress/&quot;&gt;Mark Marino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decontextualize.com/&quot;&gt;Allison Parrish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://selfloud.net/&quot;&gt;Anastasia Salter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://annettevee.com/&quot;&gt;Annette Vee&lt;/a&gt;, are currently working through these entanglements of writing with programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None these remarks is intended to diminish minimal design projects or software such as Jekyll. I use Jekyll for my own teaching and research. When compared with platforms such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, it’s quite conducive to making, maintaining, updating, and reusing &lt;a href=&quot;https://jentery.github.io/cspt500/&quot;&gt;course websites&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. Nevertheless, &lt;em&gt;the discourse of “minimal design” as a synonym for “minimal computing” may mask the totality of production in favor of demarcation or distillation&lt;/em&gt; (e.g., as if programming isn’t involved in the composition process, or as if the web is ever just content). As a way to engage the discourse and practice of minimal design, we might consider what we marginalize, reify, or appropriate through minimal design techniques and minimalist aesthetics, in addition to how we define “we” in relation to necessity and simplicity. How are we to interpret the renaissance of simple sites or flat interfaces? What’s the link between simplicity and trust? Who or what does simplicity ignore? We might also explore how necessity is intertwined with creative action (as distinct, if you will, from work or labor; see Arendt [1958]) and whether such necessity is external to minimal computing. Is necessity something we seek as a result of minimal computing projects (e.g., they meet certain research or community needs), or is it internal to praxis itself (e.g., products are unimportant or of secondary interest)? Is necessity ever fulfilled, and who assumes or is given responsibility for fulfilling it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, minimal design matters for minimal computing because it surfaces the motivations and ideals of praxis through attention to aesthetics, which may not be explicit about the contingencies of their aims. In addition to, “What do we need?”, minimal design also asks, “What &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; we need?” Perhaps the answers to these two questions are identical, yet they may spark different conversations en route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-use&quot;&gt;Minimal Use&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe minimal computing has more to do with the material particulars of computation than the plain text, layouts, and interfaces of minimal design. In this regard, a minimal approach reduces the need for not only substantial storage and processing power but also a reliance on middleware, databases, peripherals, and substantial pieces of hardware. Such reduction should increase access while decreasing technology’s environmental effects (e.g., by reducing waste and energy consumption). The overlaps with minimal design are obvious here, especially if we foreground dependencies. However, interests in minimal use of resources shift from “just your &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;” to a persistence across settings and material conditions. How can we do more with less, and how durable is our work across platforms, geographic locations, economies, and infrastructures? With these questions in mind, minimal computing may afford some important counterpoints to the impulses of “big” and “macro” thinking, at least when we determine how much technology a given project demands and at what costs. We witness, for instance, a gradual move from mainframes,  supercomputing, and even personal computing (PC) to distributed computing (or big hardware to small hardware), with the latter lending itself to “post-PC” physical computing platforms such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arduino.cc/&quot;&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; as well as operating systems such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QRO3gKj3qw&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. Big data no longer requires big computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, the primary issue confronting this sort of minimal computing is the emerging politics of an Internet of Things (IoT), which is conducive to networked surveillance, reliance on the cloud, and the proliferation of algorithms and computer vision for decision-making (e.g., Haraway’s informatics of domination [1991]; see also Aneesh [2006], Browne [2015] and Sterling [2005]). We hear about “smart cities” and “smart oceans,” which, at least in theory, may help us become more aware of our consumption habits or our treatment of nature as a standing reserve. Critical work in this area (e.g., by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityasplatform.org/&quot;&gt;Beth Coleman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jennifergabrys.net/&quot;&gt;Jennifer Gabrys&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffreyschnapp.com/2015/10/09/the-shape-of-things-to-come/&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Schnapp&lt;/a&gt;) asks how such intelligence is embedded in culture. How is a subject defined? How do environments or objects produce data? What happens when small hardware components are distributed across infrastructures? Who gets to access what sort of data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an IoT, we see a curious irony at play: a reduction in the size and demands of hardware decreases the perceived mediation of social and environmental relations (e.g., Weiser’s ubiquitous computing and calm technology [1991]) while also increasing the programmability of those relations and even of matter. (Perhaps matter &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a relation, but that’s material for another thought piece.) As hardware gets smaller, networks grow. But, &lt;em&gt;as we need to use less tech to build durable intelligent systems with more influence, we also need to ask how agency, accountability, and responsibility are changing&lt;/em&gt; (e.g., Barad’s agential realism [2007]). While not all minimal computing projects are IoT projects, the latter are susceptible to assumptions that networks or algorithms alone create data or make decisions. That is, if technology is out of our way or rendered invisible with an IoT (if we use less technology in our everyday lived realities), then it accrues even more authority as an agent or participant (e.g., it uses us). To better understand this tendency, minimal computing techniques could help us research how IoT infrastructures are manufactured (beyond concepts, metaphors, and interfaces), under what assumptions about agency and authority, and through what types of human and nonhuman contributions. Research in minimal computing may also highlight how the reduced use and costs of certain platforms are articulated with subscription services and the labor demanded by those services (e.g., what we are paying to access data in the cloud and how we compensate people for the work of data production). As we minimize reliance on particular resources, what vulnerabilities emerge? As we reduce dependencies and repeated use in one area, how do we increase dependencies and repeated use (knowingly or not) in others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, minimal computing as the minimal use of resources underscores how social processes change alongside infrastructural shifts and trends. (For more on infrastructure studies, see Bowker and Star [1999], Mattern [2013], Parks and Starosielski [2015], and Starosielski [2015], e.g.) With these changes come questions of &lt;em&gt;where we locate agency&lt;/em&gt; amidst the programmability of matter and relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-consumption&quot;&gt;Minimal Consumption&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In areas such as political economy, many critics are skeptical of action focused on reduced consumption (e.g., it’s too responsive, or it tends to ignore conditions of production); nonetheless, this approach appears common in minimal computing, where consumption may be decreased through critical use. Consider the minimal consumption of proprietary technologies, which almost always depend on cycles of planned obsolescence; or slowing down the transformation of consumption into production via the careful deliberation and study of technologies (e.g., reading history and theory alongside computing, or experimenting with multiple infrastructures against early adoption of the dominant platform); or increased collective consciousness about how and why digital technologies are sourced, manufactured, accumulated, and discarded. These examples stress how reduced consumption operates against consumption’s increased speed and turnover, and they also privilege conscious attention to embodied labor processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; remains a fundamental challenge for reduced consumption, especially as we assert the need for more imagination and research (especially collaborative research) amidst the storm of progress and its attendant metrics. After all, reduced consumption is frequently associated with creativity, craft, experimentation, or serious leisure (Stalp 2006), not work. In many sectors, it brushes against the grain of progress. It is not immediately productive of value (including products or commodities), and it’s quite difficult to measure as an output or task in management software. Plus, many practitioners struggle to carve out such time and to convince institutions that it’s necessary for informed or critical production, even if many creative and experimental practices can be performed quite quickly, perhaps out of habit. The deliberation afforded by careful research may therefore be &lt;em&gt;less a question of moving fast or slow and more about how time is valued and negotiated within institutions&lt;/em&gt;. What are we given time to do? What’s expected of that time? When, echoing Stuart Hall’s work on cultural studies, do we have moments and spaces to interrupt “This is so, is it not?” with “No, it’s not” (Hall 1990: 14)? As computing increasingly ravels with progress, crisis, efficiencies, metrics, “common sense,” and “practical training,” these moments and spaces appear all the more crucial to decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, then, this is the crucial question concerning reduced consumption: &lt;em&gt;How might minimal computing increase our shared capacities to think or imagine, and not just our individual capacities to work or produce?&lt;/em&gt; Such shared capacities are what Marx (1857-58), Nick Dyer-Witheford (1999), and Christian Fuchs (2016) call the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch14.htm&quot;&gt;“general intellect.”&lt;/a&gt; Minimal computing suggests we can engage shared capacities to think or imagine without resorting to theory/practice or yack/hack binaries (e.g., internalized life of the mind vs. externalized products of work). For example, researchers may study the histories and politics of technologies by prototyping them with physical computing techniques (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://edwardjonesimhotep.com/&quot;&gt;Edward Jones-Imhotep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kimknight.com/&quot;&gt;Kim Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://williamjturkel.net/&quot;&gt;Bill Turkel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jwernimont.com/category/vibrantlives/&quot;&gt;Vibrant Lives&lt;/a&gt;). However, this critical approach need not render history or politics as something discrete or measurable (to be consumed). Instead, prototyping becomes experimental inquiry (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danielarosner.com/&quot;&gt;Daniela K. Rosner&lt;/a&gt;), or the creative potential to conduct compelling research through technologies against positivist or instrumentalist orientations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we describe minimal computing as minimal consumption, then minimal computing is about what we need (see Gil) and also what we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;. It might help us determine how much time, or what sort of time, is necessary to conclude which infrastructures and practices are most desirable, where, and by whom. In this sense, it’s not about asceticism or withdrawal. It’s about  interventing in norms via heterogeneous time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-maintenance&quot;&gt;Minimal Maintenance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might say that minimal computing simply decreases the maintenance of machines and related configurations/formats (e.g,. the release of new standards and technologies to rejuvenate production). With less fixed capital and fewer updates required by a given system, perhaps we can focus more on content and shared capacities to think and imagine. Or, without so many WYSIWYG interfaces (What You See Is What You Get), perhaps we can attend more to writing, language, and composition (again, see Weiser [1991]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other perspectives on this list, this position is intimately related to other factors, especially minimal use and minimal design. Still, an emphasis on maintenance is more of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://longnow.org/about/&quot;&gt;“long now”&lt;/a&gt; issue popularized by Stewart Brand and Brian Eno but also studied by scholars such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karikraus.com/&quot;&gt;Kari Kraus&lt;/a&gt;. It asks us to consider the formats we choose, their change histories, their flexibility over time, and their demand for updates. For example, where will this GO::DH project be, and in what state, in 2056? An emphasis on maintenance also privileges stewarding over other paradigms for scholarly communication. For me, an important byproduct of long now thinking and maintenance is the question, &lt;em&gt;Who do we expect to keep these machines running, and for how long?&lt;/em&gt; What’s an ethical expectation? What’s realistic? What remains and gains traction after the whiz bang of new tech subsides? Or, following work by media scholars such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/595632&quot;&gt;Wendy Chun&lt;/a&gt; (2008) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samplereality.com/2010/01/18/the-archive-or-the-trace-cultural-permanence-and-the-fugitive-text/&quot;&gt;Mark Sample&lt;/a&gt; (2010), what if we foreground ephemerality over persistence or permanence? What does ephemerality teach us, and how does it endure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, minimal computing may be about long-term control over means of production. If we control the means, then we may also oversee maintenance, design, and distribution. On the other hand, minimal computing may encourage low-cost or low-stakes experimentation (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://ojcs.siue.edu/ojs/index.php/polymath/article/view/2853&quot;&gt;Kathy Harris’s notion of “single-day bloom and fade projects”&lt;/a&gt; [2013]), without much concern for persistence or related maintenance issues. More important, combining studies of the persistent with the ephemeral highlights how practitioners invest in the materiality of minimal computing for its aesthetics and politics (e.g., the speculative aesthetics of the long now and the labor politics of maintenance). In fact, the very notion of materiality suggests something is not material, or something cannot be permanently inscribed, captured, stored, preserved, or the like. With maintenance (however minimal), there are always changes, and minimal computing brings the importance of these changes to our attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-barriers&quot;&gt;Minimal Barriers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its associations with open software and hardware, minimal computing may be defined as a reduction in barriers to entry and access. For example, it may use source materials that can be modified and are licensed for distribution (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;). In this case, an important question is how much knowledge “open” assumes prior to participation. That is, access to source materials alone does not equal democratization; people still need to know how to participate in production. Also, as Chris Kelty (2008) demonstrates, openness is part of a social imaginary steeped in technical and moral practices. It cannot be reduced to a technical feature. Such technical features may include paywalls as well as file formats, both of which are frequently referenced in debates about open access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, minimal computing may also rely on design strategies and standards that strive for universal access (e.g., by everyone regardless of disability; see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt;) and avoid or reduce features, such as hover states and animations, that are not easy to see, read, hear, navigate, or find. These approaches tend to underscore consistency, the fundamentals of design, shared accessibility guidelines, a healthy skepticism of early adoption/implementation, responsiveness across devices and platforms, personalization, clarity, description, and regular evaluations (or user testing) of content across needs, audiences, and settings (e.g., the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://webaim.org/&quot;&gt;WebAIM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS&quot;&gt;JAWS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nuance.com/dragon/index.htm&quot;&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/&quot;&gt;W3C Markup Validation Services&lt;/a&gt;). They also position exclusionary design as bad design. While this position may differ from the legacy aesthetics of minimalism (e.g., refinement through the use of essential elements), design performed according to accessibility guidelines increases the robustness and overall quality of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From yet another perspective on entry and access, minimal computing engages social approaches to materials and built environments (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://ablersite.org/&quot;&gt;Sara Hendren’s Adaptation and Ability group at Olin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/67784&quot;&gt;Hannah Perner-Wilson’s Kit-of-No-Parts&lt;/a&gt; [2011]). Here, “minimal” implies low-tech methods whereby materials are responsive and even shape themselves to the needs of specific people or situations. These methods redirect physical computing research from an IoT extraction of data (or the treatment of environments and people as data) toward &lt;em&gt;social and cultural praxis premised on negotiations with materials and structures&lt;/em&gt;. If an IoT is motivated by reducing barriers to data gathering (through the use of sensors and addressable objects) for social/scientific progress, then adaptability and negotiation paradigms seek to reduce barriers to mobility and participation. Of course, this scenario need not be a zero sum game (e.g., surely there are various manifestations of an IoT; contrary to the vernacular, it is not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; IoT). Nevertheless, there is, at least historically speaking, a tension between progress and negotiation as frameworks for technology and action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across these examples, minimal computing as minimal barriers foregrounds the motivations for rendering content and computing accessible, including how “entry” and “access” are defined and which barriers are reduced or removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-internet&quot;&gt;Minimal Internet&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following projects such as Gil and Dennis Tenen’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xpmethod/no-connect&quot;&gt;No Connect&lt;/a&gt; (a static site generator that works on a local machine or a USB key, without an HTML server), perhaps minimal computing is computing off the internet. This approach retains the affordances of new media when practitioners cannot or do not use the internet for distribution and exchange. As Gil and Tenen suggest, histories of “sneakernets” (exchanging files via removable media) are points of comparison here. These histories may  inform how practitioners reduce the attack vectors and vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting, SQL injections, and directory traversals) of activist projects targeted for hacking and other forms on online violence. (For an example project, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/minimal-computing/action-defense.html&quot;&gt;#feminism action defense&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/&quot;&gt;GO::DH&lt;/a&gt; mission reminds us, &lt;em&gt;the distinction between choice and necessity is significant&lt;/em&gt; in this instance. When is minimal computing a trend (e.g., in high-income economies), and when is it a reality (e.g., where people cannot physically/socially access the internet)? How do we practice minimization without romanticizing life before or without the web? Through shared capacities, how do we collaborate across economies and settings instead of appropriating cultural forms and practices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-externals&quot;&gt;Minimal Externals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimal computing also brings to mind histories of do-it-yourself (DIY) or do-it-ourselves (DIO) production involving minimal external intervention (e.g., self-publishing). Practitioners may steward their own data, publish their own content, write their own scripts, build their own hardware, or avoid proprietary technologies. Of course, the cultures of DIY and DIO may range from radical to socially conservative (see their variants in punk, indie game dev, and “slow computing,” e.g.); however, a key issue across this range is &lt;em&gt;how control is articulated&lt;/em&gt;. Is a project seizing the means of production because its practitioners have been silenced, ignored, attacked by, or excluded from existing norms, forms, and outlets? Or is the desire for control more about possessive individualism or free will? How are cultural values assigned to the means as opposed to the mode of production, and under what assumptions about whether/how technology changes culture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At stake here are the ways in which practitioners determine how stages of production (such as fabrication, circulation, exchange, consumption, and use) mediate social relations and agency. While this observation may sound rather theoretical, attendant issues of power and self-organization shape an array of minimal computing practices, such as where repositories are housed, who maintains and contributes to them, who moderates and reviews them, and how they are accessed now and down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-automation&quot;&gt;Minimal Automation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might also understand minimal computing as minimal automation, or the reduced reliance on algorithms and software that magically (or so it seems) process this into that. From this position, minimal computing may be more invested in instruments than machines, as the latter alienate and objectify knowledge production while the former merely aid or guide it. Projects involving minimal automation would ostensibly afford greater personal or collective awareness of how decisions are made and data is produced, even when those decisions and data are processed at a rate beyond human perception and apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-space&quot;&gt;Minimal Space&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the size of computers decreases, presumably their demands for physical space decrease, too. This twofold decrease raises a number of social issues steeped in design: When and why do we need physical spaces, such as labs and studios, for technological work? How are spaces, norms, and social relations changing as many people rely less on desktop computers? How do we understand communication and attention during this shift (Hayes 2007)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the lack of physical space required for computation suggests increased flexibility. Work can be conducted in a variety of places, and data is easier to move around, too. We may no longer need the “brick and mortar” venues we once did. Or, spaces start to resemble new media (Manovich 2001), at least in their modularity and variability. We see multi-purpose rooms, co-working offices, pay-per-use venues, and event hubs within the same building, for instance. Yet, on the other hand, this “pop up” flexibility places a particular burden on claims for, and the costs of, dedicated spaces (e.g., why would you need a lab or studio for that?), which remain central to community organizing and experimental inquiry. Practices often need places to call home or for culture to congeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-technical-language&quot;&gt;Minimal Technical Language&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps minimal computing means minimal technical language, or less investment in performing the language of field specialization. This idea is conjectural at best. Nevertheless, I’m considering possibilities where an emphasis on social issues could reduce or reposition the use of technical language in conversations about computing and technologies in particular. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pamelaz.com/MP3s/Geekspeak%20Excerpt.mp3&quot;&gt;Pamela Z’s compositions&lt;/a&gt; and Carolyn Marvin’s research on inventing technical expertise via discourse and communication (1988) come to mind here, as does Alexander Galloway’s remark that Argus was “bored to death” by Hermes’s “tales about technology” (e.g., the “story of how the reed pipe was invented”) (Galloway 2014: 36).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But none of these observations suggests that technical details (or historical details, or conceptual details) do not matter. They certainly do, and they are undoubtedly significant (see Kirschenbaum’s convincing notion of a medial ideology [2008: 36], e.g.). Rather, I’m suggesting that, with computing work, it’s easy to become preoccupied with technical details and specialization, which often ostracize people or inhibit participation, especially by those who are unfamiliar with or skeptical of certain technologies. Maybe, then, minimal computing could become &lt;em&gt;a space for building a common language about shared concerns across technology and culture&lt;/em&gt;. This language could be informed by various experiences and specializations, with an emphasis on privileging difference while also collaboratively identifying and approaching pressing problems. It’s a bit blue sky, I know. Still, as I mentioned before, minimal computing could be approached around the question, “What do we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;minimal-&quot;&gt;Minimal …&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not account for all the minimals or their particulars here. The ones I did include do not cohere into a single paradigm or method, either. For now, I’ve also resisted any sort of synthesis, but I hope to pursue such work with others as we proceed with the Minimal Computing Working Group. In the meantime, I welcome your thoughts at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jentery@uvic.ca&quot;&gt;jentery@uvic.ca&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jenterysayers&quot;&gt;@jenterysayers&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>Minimal Definitions (tl;dr)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/&quot;&gt;GO::DH Minimal Computing Working Group&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been researching the various uses and implications of “minimal computing.” What does it mean? According to whom? For whom? Under what assumptions? I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/mindefinitions/&quot;&gt;thought piece on the topic&lt;/a&gt;, but below is the tl;dr version of my observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimal computing appears to prompt some fundamental questions about choice and necessity: “What do we need?” (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/&quot;&gt;Gil&lt;/a&gt;) “What don’t we need?” “What do we want?” “What don’t we want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definitions/perspectives below point to some interesting overlaps and tensions between the multiple aims (stated or not) of minimal computing. For now, tho, I’m listing them here without synthesis, analysis, or any assumption that the list is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Design&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the need to update/modify the structure or layout of a project in order to focus on content production and to increase the likelihood of project persistence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalist Design&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the use of features to highlight a project’s fundamental components across platforms/devices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal WYSIWYG&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the use of What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) interfaces to decrease resource demands, increase awareness of programming and markup processes, and also increase individual focus on writing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce reliance on scripts, databases, libraries, versions, and software to decrease resource demands and processing time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce dependencies and the use of features to decrease the labor of updating, moderating, and stewarding a project over time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Ephemerality&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce an impulse to inscribe, measure, or visualize with technologies in order to increase the likelihood of experimentation and collective participation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the use of natural resources and technologies (especially hardware, middleware, and peripherals) to decrease environmental effects and energy consumption&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Consumption&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce arguments premised on technological progress, the early adoption/implementation of technologies, and the treatment of computing as work (to create products) in order to increase deliberation, thoroughness of research, and the likelihood of informed decisions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Obsolescence&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce turnover of technologies, standards, and formats to increase reuse and decrease waste/discards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Presence&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the use of laptops, desktops, and other computers in order to prototype with low-tech materials (clay, paper, pencils), decrease reliance on automation, and increase comparative studies (across digital and analog media)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Visibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the perceived intervention of technologies to facilitate interaction as well as the production/extraction of data from those interactions/behaviors (Internet of Things)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Access&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the use of proprietary technologies and paywalls to increase access to content, data, and/or source files&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Through shared guidelines and frequent user testing, reduce the use of features that are difficult to see, read, hear, translate, use, navigate, process, store, or find toward access by everyone and to also increase the overall quality and consistency of projects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Justice&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the use of technological, cultural, social, and economic barriers to increase entry, access, participation, and self-representation in computing and to also build systems/projects premised on social justice and difference, not white supremacy and settler colonialism&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Learning Curve&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the experience assumed or required to participate in computing and technological work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Negotiation&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the rigidity of form, composition, and use to increase the personalization, adaptability, responsiveness, and/or robustness of technologies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Internet&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce reliance on the internet for communication, exchange, and participation to account for or privilege local conditions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce or eliminate the default assumption that internet access is evenly distributed in order to account for material and social conditions of communications and exchange&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Surveillance&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the use of sensors, computer vision, cookies, and other tracking mechanisms to increase privacy and security and to decrease harassment and hacks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce attack vectors (e.g., cross-site scripting, SQL injections, and directory traversals) of projects to decrease likelihood of hacks and harassment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Externals&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce dependency on external groups or mechanisms to produce, exchange, and circulate your own projects and content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Automation&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce use of mechanisms that (magically) turn input into output in order to increase awareness of how this becomes that or how algorithms/tools make decisions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Space&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the physical space dedicated to hardware and workstations to increase the flexible use, variability, and modularity of that space&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce dependency on fixed technologies (e.g., desktops plugged into walls) to increase movement, performance, and participation across events and settings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Technical Language&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce the use of specialized language to increase participation and engagement with shared technocultural problems&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Translation - Machination</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Christine Mitchell and Rita Raley edited a special issue of &lt;em&gt;Amodern&lt;/em&gt; in 2018. It’s titled “Translation-Machination,” and in the introduction they write: “we simply still care about language as a particular kind of medium–and in our contemporary computational environments, questions about what language is, how it moves, and how it is used, manipulated, maintained, transformed, and understood seem more pressing than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Tiffany Chan and Mara Mills, I contributed to this special issue. Our essay focuses on &lt;a href=&quot;/optophone&quot;&gt;optophonics&lt;/a&gt; (the conversion of type into audible tones) as a form of transcription for blind readers during the first half of the 20th century. Our case study for optophonics is Mary Jameson’s widely ignored contributions to what became optical character recognition (the conversion of page images into machine-readable text), and our approach combines Mara’s archival research with the MLab’s prototyping techniques for 2D to 3D translation. The essay also includes some historical audio and demonstrations that Mara digitized, together with braille letters transcribed by Shafeka Hashash. We stress throughout the piece the importance of “suboptimal design” to prototyping and media history. Such design privileges attention to maintenance and negotiation over novelty and automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essay, titled “Optophonic Reading, Prototyping Optophones,” was the MLab’s first co-authored piece with a researcher at another institution. Tiffany and I learned a tremendous amount from Mara and her archival work, and Christine and Rita’s special issue was a perfect fit for the collaboration. The entire issue is excellent. It features work by Christine and Rita as well as Otso Huopaniemi, John Cayley, Avery Slater, Quinn DuPont, Andrew Pilsch, Nick Montfort, Jane Birkin, Karin Littau, and Joe Milutis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A link, abstract, and acknowledgments for “Optophonic Reading, Prototyping Optophones” (open access) are below. I also point to a 2021 talk at Lawrence Technological University where I applied this research to the topic of worldbuilding. Many thanks to Tiffany and Mara for writing with me, and to Christine and Rita for their editorial work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article details the contributions of blind readers to the development, design, and marketing of the optophone, a text-to-tone transcription machine introduced in the early twentieth century. We combine archival research with prototyping to investigate the dimensions involved in past coding and decoding practices. If archives provide testimonial fragments about individual use, 2D to 3D translation helps scholars to more broadly characterize optophone reading and understand technical affordances.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Design without a Future</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I published “Design without a Future” in the November / December 2016 issue of &lt;em&gt;ACM Interactions&lt;/em&gt;, a bimonthly publication about design and human-computer interaction. The essay features the MLab’s research and exhibit on early magnetic recording, including several photographs by Danielle Morgan. I was invited by Daniela K. Rosner to submit the piece, and she ultimately edited it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s meant by “design without a future”? With a nod to Roland Barthes’s &lt;em&gt;Camera Lucida&lt;/em&gt;, the phrase positions prototyping not as a speculation about possible futures but rather as a negotiation with media history. It also stresses the fact that many early technologies are no longer accessible: they are not in circulation, or they’re broken, or they don’t work (as intended) anymore. Remaking them is thus about attending to contingencies, not recovering ideal builds or designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are links to the essay (subscription required), a related talk (about early magnetic recording) I gave at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, a conversation I had about media history and prototyping on KHPR 88.1 FM Hawaiʻi public radio, and a page detailing the MLab’s research on the topic. With permission, I’ve also compressed all of Danielle’s photographs and included the &lt;em&gt;ACM Interactions&lt;/em&gt; sample of the essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Daniela for the invitation and editorial work; to Danielle, Teddie Brock, Tiffany Chan, Katherine Goertz, and Victoria Murawski for their contributions to the research and exhibit; and to Danielle for the photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lab I direct, we prototype technologies that no longer exist or no longer function. Within the field of comparative media studies, this approach is somewhat atypical, mostly because historians and theorists usually treat media as objects of study, not materials for inquiry. Each of our prototypes corresponds with a year somewhere between 1840 and 1940. For instance, we recently conducted an early magnetic recording experiment from 1898. It was probably the first sound recording of its kind. We prototyped the components using a combination of sourced and fabricated materials. We then installed the prototype in the Audain Gallery at the University of Victoria (UVic).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The MLab</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The MLab (short for The Maker Lab in the Humanities) opened its doors at UVic in September 2012 and was active through May 2018. I was both director and PI during this period, and our research priority areas were physical computing, fabrication, and exhibits. The MLab blended cultural criticism with prototyping, and its design integrated a humanities research lab with a makerspace. The lab’s researchers came from English, Visual Arts, and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought at UVic, with funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund (BCKDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the early years, we focused mostly on the space and culture of the lab. What practices and values should be at play in a humanities makerspace, and how could such a space best support students and experimental work? This video by Nina Belojevic, Arthur Hain, Shaun Macpherson, and Katie Tanigawa, with contributions from Cathy Davidson (then Duke, now CUNY), Derek Jacoby (UVic), Kari Kraus (Maryland), Tara McPherson (USC), and Bethany Nowviskie (then UVA, now JMU), offers a glimpse into those years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/67094032?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we developed the space and culture of the MLab and also expanded to establish a Fab Lab with Visual Arts at UVic, we began to ask how and why we might prototype early technologies that no longer exist or no longer function. How, in short, could prototyping be a form of inquiry for media history? Following Fluxus and a few suggestions from Bill Turkel at Western, we created “Kits for Cultural History.” We published four volumes in the &lt;a href=&quot;/fluxkits&quot;&gt;Kits&lt;/a&gt; series: three from UVic and one by Helen J. Burgess and Margaret Simon at North Carolina State University. The Kits encourage embodied engagements and conjecture with history, against instrumentalist tendencies to use new tech (such as CNC machines) to solve or fix problems. They also foreground the social, cultural, and labor dimensions of media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video by Teddie Brock, Tiffany Chan, Katherine Goertz, Danielle Morgan, and Victoria Murawski shares three of the Kits as well as the MLab’s approach to research and research-creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the MLab’s final year, we refined our inquiry into a series of communicable methods and began illustrating them for practitioners interested in media history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While directing the MLab, I had the honor of collaborating with an amazing team of wonderful people at UVic.

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the MLab&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The Maker Lab in the Humanities (MLab) at the University of Victoria (UVic) opened our doors in September 2012 under the direction of Jentery Sayers (English and CSPT). With research priority areas in physical computing, digital fabrication, and exhibits, the MLab intersects cultural criticism with experimental prototyping and electronics. As the Lab’s name suggests, our design blends a humanities research lab with a collaborative makerspace—a design that affords our team of students and faculty opportunities to build projects through various modes of knowing by doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MLab’s use of “maker” and “making” understands both words on a broad spectrum, to include writing and composition in addition to tinkering, coding, crafting, bending, sketching, prototyping, and fabricating (among many others). The lab resists impulses to reduce technical work and tacit knowledge to practices in “service” of scholarship. Invested in the entanglements of media with matter, all of our projects engage the material relations between the past and present, digital and analog, persistent and ephemeral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://maker.uvic.ca/projects/&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; include The Crocodile Café Exhibit, The Humanities Lab as a Makerspace, The “Hello World” Workshop Series, The Long Now of &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, Building Public Humanities, Kits for Cultural History, The Early Wearables Kit, The Early Magnetic Recording Kit, The Reading Optophone Kit, and a one-week intensive course on physical computing and fabrication in the humanities. We also support HASTAC Scholars at UVic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve hosted numerous visiting researchers, including Alexandrine Boudreault-Fournier, Tanja Carstensen, Ed Chang, Tanya Clement, Garnet Hertz, Jesse Colin Jackson, merritt k, Fiona Keenan, Julie Thompson Klein, Doran Larson, Lisa Nakamura, Bethany Nowviskie, Daniela Rosner, and Lynne Siemens, and we’ve funded research across the Arts and Humanities at UVic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For details about our work, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://maker.uvic.ca/twoyears/&quot;&gt;“The Maker Lab after Two Years (2012-14)”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://maker.uvic.ca/twoyears2/&quot;&gt;“The MLab: A Two-Year Review (2014-16)”&lt;/a&gt;, which include month-by-month accounts of our research and service activities, together with plenty of links and images. Also see UVic’s Fab Lab, which we established in collaboration with Visual Arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is not to attribute prototypes, publications, and other forms of scholarly communication to the MLab as a brand or author. It’s also not to create tools. It’s to prompt students to conduct experimental research they can call their own, on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading Optophone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading optophones helped blind readers to translate type into audible tones. Operators learned over time to distinguish patterns of tones as words or phrases. Here’s a video, by Tiffany Chan, demonstrating the scanning and sonification side of the process that is a precursor to optical character recognition (OCR), which converts page images into machine-readable text).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/279339111?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most media histories stress the invention of optophones in the 1910s without attending to their operation, maintenance, and development throughout the first half of the 20th century. As a result, they tend to ignore research by blind operators and demonstrators such as Mary Jameson, who made significant contributions to the ongoing work of character recognition and output decoding. Prototyping the optophone highlights the historical significance of Jameson’s labor in ways that archival materials and existing scholarship do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt; remade the reading optophone to foreground Mary Jameson’s contributions to media and computing history. The lab’s prototype includes a laser-cut frame and runs Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) with a camera attached. The Reading Optophone is the third volume in the lab’s “Kits for Cultural History” series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are an official description of the Optophone Kit, acknowledgments, and a README that Tiffany wrote, with instructions and Python scripts for running the prototype on an RPi. I also link to a downloadable repository for the Kit and some essays and talks Tiffany and/or I wrote about optophonics. The video below demonstrates stages of the prototyping process, from an artifact in storage to a fabricated object in the MLab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;README&lt;/strong&gt;, by Tiffany Chan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/lab/mLabOptophoneKit.zip&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; for the Optophone Kit, part of the Maker Lab’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://maker.uvic.ca/kch/&quot;&gt;Kits for Cultural History&lt;/a&gt; series. The optophone was an aid for blind readers that converted text into sound in the 20th century, beginning in the 1910s and extending until at least the 1960s. To read more about the process of remaking the optophone, see our &lt;a href=&quot;http://maker.uvic.ca/?s=optophone&amp;amp;search=&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://maker.uvic.ca/&quot;&gt;maker.uvic.ca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These files are part of research conducted by Tiffany Chan (project lead), Katherine Goertz, Danielle Morgan, Victoria Murawski, and Jentery Sayers. Thanks to Robert Baker (Blind Veterans UK), Mara Mills (New York University), and Matthew Rubery (Queen Mary University of London) for their support and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;
These instructions detail the workflow and steps for converting an image into plaintext and then into a stream of optophonic sounds. Currently, the repo contains 3 scripts, written in the Python programming language. As the Kit develops, some of the scripts may change or be combined together (see the change log).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/archive/lab/ocrScript.py&quot;&gt;ocrScript.py&lt;/a&gt;: takes an image from the PiCamera, runs it through OCR (optical character recognition)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/archive/lab/toneGen.py&quot;&gt;toneGen.py&lt;/a&gt;: creates and saves optophonic sounds for later playback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/archive/lab/optoScript.py&quot;&gt;optoScript.py&lt;/a&gt;: takes a string of characters as its input and plays the corresponding sounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
To run these scripts, you will need to download and install Python. See the Python website for instructions on how to do this. Note that the optophone project uses Python version 2.7. The scripts and dependencies should work with Python 3, but there may be slight differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several dependencies (Python modules or packages) that must be installed before the scripts can work. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PiCamera: for taking a picture with the Raspberry Pi camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OpenCV: a computer vision and image processing program (the optophone project uses version 3.0.0)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pillow/PIL: Python Imaging Library, also for working with images&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tesseract: a free OCR program&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pyTesser: a Python wrapper for Tesseract (basically, how Python talks to Tesseract)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pyGame: for playing sounds with Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the optophone project, these were all installed on a Raspberry Pi. Except for ocrScript.py, all scripts should work on a laptop or personal computer. You can also modify ocrScript.py to take an arbitrary image as its input instead of an image from a Raspberry Pi camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here’s a basic workflow for the optophone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set up everything you need. Set up all the hardware (the Raspberry Pi, PiCamera), and any other peripherals (e.g. monitor, mouse, keyboard) you might need. Download and install any dependencies. Download all the Python scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create and save tones for the optophone to play. Currently, optoScript.py only plays the tones for lowercase a, b, and c. You can download the sound files in the tones folder to use them for playback or modify and run toneGen.py to generate different tones (note you will probably have to change the dictionary in optoScript.py to match). To make things easier, you can keep the tones in the same directory (folder) as your scripts. Otherwise, make sure the script can find the correct file path to your sound files.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a picture of the print material and turn it into plaintext. Position the camera to take a picture of the text. Ideally, you will want an image with bright lighting and where the text will take up as much of the image as possible (i.e., little to no background). This will make the image easier for the computer to read. ocrScript.py and Tesseract (the OCR program) will optimize the image as best as they can. Modify ocrScript.py as necessary (see notes below) and run it. ocrScript.py will convert the image into a plaintext file named results.txt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run optoScript.py to read the results.txt file (make sure results.txt is in the same folder/directory as optoscript.py) and play the associated sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes on Using the Scripts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The current scripts were made for testing small samples of code. To use them to express your own text as tones, you may have to modify it. For example, the dictionary of tones, as it is recorded in optoScript.py, only contains 3 entries for lowercase a, b, and c. You would have to change the dictionary to include the tones for other characters before you could play them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other places where code may be modified are noted in the scripts themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Minimal Computing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Minimal Computing” is a Global Outlook::Digital Humanities (GO::DH) working group invested in the entanglements of computing with infrastructure and culture. I chair the group with John Simpson, and in Summer 2017 I taught a graduate seminar on the topic. That seminar drew from Hartmut Obendorf’s research (2009) to look at functional, structural, architectural, and compositional forms of minimal computing as a creative and analytical framework. Students and I foregrounded notions of access, infrastructure, labor, and persistence against various types of scope, function, and feature creep common in project design and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official description of the minimal computing seminar is below. I link to the course website and syllabus as well as to “Minimal Definitions,” a thought piece I wrote about what we may mean when we say, “minimal computing.” The piece is a tad long, so I wrote a tl;dr version, too. Alongside these resources I link to the website for the GO::DH working group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in learning more about minimal computing, then I recommend thought pieces on the GO::DH website by Alex Gil, Gabriel Egan, Joel Hughes, Kim Brillante Knight, Meredith Levin, Anne B. McGrail, and Stewart Varner in addition to projects by Gil, Manan Ahmed, Maira E. Álvarez, Sylvia A. Fernández, Kaiama L. Glover, Kelly Baker Josephs, Merisa Martinez, Roopika Risam, Linda Rodriguez, Moacir P. de Sá Pereira, Dennis Tenen, and the xpmethod group at Columbia University. There’s also the “Minimal Digital Humanities: Choice or Necessity?” panel (link below), which gathered at the 2017 Modern Language Association convention in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Alex Gil and Brian Rosenblum for designing the Minimal Computing website, and to Gil, John Simpson, and Dan O’Donnell for collaborating with me to organize the group’s first meeting on 8 July 2014 in Lausanne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Computing&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
Summer 2017 | UVic English 507 | Grad seminar for 12 students&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://jentery.github.io/minimal/&quot;&gt;course website&lt;/a&gt; (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/507v5/mincomp5072017.pdf&quot;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt; (PDF); &lt;a href=&quot;/mindefinitions/&quot;&gt;thought piece&lt;/a&gt; on defining minimal computing (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;/mindeftldr/&quot;&gt;tl;dr version&lt;/a&gt; of the thought piece (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/&quot;&gt;GO::DH working group&lt;/a&gt; (HTML); MLA &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/talks/mla17&quot;&gt;panel&lt;/a&gt; (HTML)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seminar introduces you to the histories and principles of digital literary and cultural studies. Digital literary studies involve the interpretation of electronic literature but also the use of digital technologies to examine and remediate literature. How, for instance, is literature composed for screens or through algorithms? Or how is it analyzed by machines and encoded for discovery, scanning, and preservation? Overlapping with many literary questions, digital cultural studies entail the interpretation of new media and computational cultures, but also the integration of digital technologies into cultural production. How, for example, do labour practices morph with the internet and social networks? Or how do scholarship and other communications transform or expand with platforms? Both fields are unique (or simply odd) within the humanities because they blend technical knowledge with creative and critical approaches to research questions. Both fields also engage matters of design: interests in interfaces, interactions, graphics, systems, code, reuse, stewardship, performance, materiality, and information architecture, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the centrality of design to digital literary and cultural studies, this introductory seminar combines cultural criticism with creative and technical practices by treating design as inquiry. Design is not something found in objects. A technology does not “have” design. Design is not an idea, either. A person does not imagine a design on their own. Like any labour practice, design is social; it is also a negotiation with materials and forces. In digital studies, design encourages us to ask how stuff is composed, under what assumptions, by whom, for whom, and to what effects. It also prompts us to consider how digital stuff and its conditions can change. What else was it? What else will it be? What else could or should it be? How does change happen not just around it, but with or through it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a mess, right? To keep us focused, this seminar narrows design in digital studies to minimal computing in particular. Minimal computing foregrounds access, infrastructure, and persistence against various types of scope, function, and feature creep now common in fields such as digital humanities, where projects are never done. This creep usually happens because technologies make it possible to add all the things to the inquiry at hand. Lines become increasingly difficult to draw as digital projects continue to grow. You could say minimal computing serves as a corrective of sorts; more accurately, it is an analytical and creative framework for navigating the politics and aesthetics of design in digital studies: a way to examine and critique as well as reuse, build, and preserve projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I selected minimalism as a heuristic for this seminar because it is: 1) conducive to an introduction; it fosters attention to specific elements of production while also bypassing assumptions of technical expertise, which may not be common in English studies; 2) impossible to engage meaningfully through critical distance alone; it entails the study of digital literature and culture from the “inside,” blending skepticism with immersion; 3) steeped in the contingencies of design; we can’t talk persuasively about minimalism as an idea or form outside of history, medium, setting, action, or ideology; 4) a popular research and discussion topic in digital studies right now, due partly to concerns about digital security, not to mention the constant maintenance and repair of digital projects; and 5) inclined to decentre the “digital” by entwining it with other formations; digital technologies and new media do not exist independently of mechanical procedures, analog machines, tactile media, people, and environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, minimal computing is not without its problems. Discursively, it functions within a collocation set that also includes “reduction,” “simplicity,” “clarity,” “limited,” “necessity,” “few,” and “flat.” These terms are value-laden; they weave materials and actions together with concepts and beliefs as they draw our attention to interesting design problems. Through case studies, workshops, discussions, project development, and a lecture or two, we will study that entanglement and those problems in the context of digital literature and culture. What are minimalist interfaces, architectures, media, and approaches in digital studies? What do they promise? What do they afford? For what are they responsible? When and why should they be adopted, rejected, or modified? By the term’s end, I’m not asking you to affirm minimal computing as a methodology or ideology. I am asking you to articulate your own position on minimal computing through an integration of immanent critique with experimental practice: to compose about, with, through, and against it. In doing so, I hope you develop a concrete sense of how digital literature and culture are written, read, and—most important for this seminar—designed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What's in a Game?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“What’s in a Game?” prompted students to produce critical media by prototyping their own games. I focused the course on indie games and critical play, and I either required the use of a specific engine (Unity 3D) or ran with student preferences (often Twine or Python). When I taught the course, I did not assume students were gamers, had any experience with game design, or were even interested in games. By the end of the course, they would prototype only a level or scene, with credits and a title screen. They also created manuals for their games as if the games were complete. Then they shared their prototypes and manuals during an end-of-term event, such as “Open the Arcade” in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are undergraduate and graduate course descriptions and links to two course websites and syllabi. I also link to descriptions of undergraduate prototypes, a UVic News article about the graduate course, the poster for “Open the Arcade,” and slides for a talk I gave at Stanford about how games, simulations, and design fictions figure into my media practice and pedagogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What we call a videogame is not a product. It’s the creation of an author and her accomplice, the player; it is handmade by the former and personally distributed to the latter. The videogame is a zine.” — Anna Anthropy, &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Videogame Zinesters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undergraduate course (2015): HELLO! This is a course about making indie games. It’s also about demystifying technologies and understanding videogames as arguments about power, systems, and social relations. I will not assume you’re a gamer, that you want to be a gamer, that you’ve ever made an indie game, or that you know how to develop, program, or design games. But I will encourage you to craft an argument about culture through your own game prototype. In short, we’re going to use games to talk about what games do, can do, or should do. Looking forward to it! For more information, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/350/&quot;&gt;course website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graduate seminar (2017): This seminar is about literary and cultural approaches to prototyping indie games—games as gifts, letters, ephemera, hacks, souvenirs, mix tapes, commentaries, glitches, jokes, tricks, satire, memoirs, self-care, lo-fi, bit collage, accidents, performances, activism, zines . . . We’ll play some games, read some history and critical theory, and experiment with an array of design and development techniques from paper to screen. Early in the term, you’ll select a few “-isms” (e.g., Futurism, Minimalism, and Surrealism) from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that will inform your approaches to prototyping throughout the seminar, and by the end you’ll create and share your own indie games, complete with their own user manuals. In the process, you’ll learn about the intersections of new media with art, literature, and politics, and we’ll demystify the popular assumption that only a “select few” can make games. I will not assume that you are a gamer, want to be a gamer, have ever made an indie game, or know how to develop or design games. I will also not assume that you’ve taken a course in digital studies. Technical competency required: know how to send an email. As you play games throughout the term, I encourage you to support the authors and developers, most of whom accept donations via Patreon or the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll study work by Aubrey Anable, Anna Anthropy, Mattie Brice, Nicky Case, Ed Chang, Naomi Clark, Mia Consalvo, Ben Esposito, Mary Flanagan, Toby Fox, Tracy Fullerton, Alexander Galloway, Patrick Jagoda, Brendan Keogh, Elizabeth LaPensée, Nathalie Lawhead, Lisa Nakamura, Allison Parrish, Celia Pearce, Amanda Phillips, Anastasia Salter, Emily Short, T.L. Taylor, Annette Vee, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, and Robert Yang. For more information, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/508v3&quot;&gt;course website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading Media in Theory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The role of media in theory (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/1771&quot;&gt;Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;) is expansive and thus difficult, if not impossible, to isolate. For one, the definitions and uses of media are historically and socially contingent. In one instance, media are carriers or vehicles; in another, they are containers or vessels; in yet another, they are intervening substances. They may be everything from matter and mechanisms to messages, relationships, and interfaces. They may be active or inert, compliant or resistant, figure or ground, middles or ends, autonomous or entangled, things or bodies, windows or frames, nature or culture, feminine or masculine, instruments or agents, ideas or practices, text or texture, fleeting or permanent, elemental or concrete, phenomena or noumena . . . the list goes on and on. Of course, my use of “or” throughout that last sentence may be part of the problem. In many cases, “and” is far more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; if we look at mentions from the 1800s forward, “media” is frequently synonymous with “material,” often with negative connotations (e.g., “just the material” or “merely media”). It’s a mess, really. But it’s a mess that prompts us to study how mediation is theorized and theory is mediated. These are important matters, especially if you’re invested in how media and materiality inform your research, methods, and lived experience (e.g., what you study, how you study it, how you share your work, how you practice or perform that work, how you identify and steward your sources, how you distinguish between this and that, or how you determine the cultural, social, and political issues that matter most to you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, then, are some questions we might ask while reading media in theory. For now, I’ve contextualized them by asking how media function as “compositions,” “objects of inquiry,” and “apparatuses.” These questions correspond with certain paradigms (e.g., idealism, materialism, formalism, phenomenology, semiotics, discourse analysis, deconstruction, performativity, and realism), which do not cohere into a single theory or worldview. In fact, there’s a lot of tension and contradiction in what follows below. However, I have decided to emphasize the important questions that emerge from the dialogue between paradigms, with little attention to which question corresponds with which -ism or label. This way, you can privilege practice by selecting aspects that apply to your interests and approaches, filling in the gaps (and there are many), correcting the shortcomings (plenty of those, too), and also considering which aspects resonate (or don’t) with your own experiences. Discard and revise as you please. These are not step-by-step instructions. This is also not a guide for negative critique (e.g., cynicism, lack, or diminution). Instead, I hope you build from it what you wish, or what you need for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In presenting these questions, I’ve drawn only from texts during in my seminar on &lt;a href=&quot;/marxbarad/&quot;&gt;“Media and Materiality: A Survey from Marx to Barad”&lt;/a&gt;: Marx’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm&quot;&gt;Notebook M&lt;/a&gt; (1857) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch13.htm#p690&quot;&gt;Fragment on Machines&lt;/a&gt; (1858), Simmel’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/simmelMoney.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Philosophy of Money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1900/78), Shklovsky’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/shklovskyDevice.pdf&quot;&gt;“Art as Device”&lt;/a&gt; (1917), Benjamin’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/benjaminTheses.pdf&quot;&gt;“Theses on the Philosophy of History”&lt;/a&gt; (1940/74), Arendt’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/arendtHumanCondition.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Human Condition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1958), Merleau-Ponty’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/merleauPontyEyeMind.pdf&quot;&gt;“Eye and Mind”&lt;/a&gt; (1961/93), Barthes’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/barthesText.pdf&quot;&gt;“From Work to Text”&lt;/a&gt; (1971/77), Foucault’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/foucaultArchaeology.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Archaeology of Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1969/72), Williams’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/williamsTelevision.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Television&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1975), Cixous’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/cixousMedusa.pdf&quot;&gt;“The Laugh of the Medusa”&lt;/a&gt; (1975/76), Lorde’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeErotic.pdf&quot;&gt;“Uses of the Erotic”&lt;/a&gt; (1978/84) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/lordeTools.pdf&quot;&gt;“The Mater’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House”&lt;/a&gt; (1979/81), Kristeva’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/kristevaAbjection.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Powers of Horror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1982), Butler’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/butlerGT.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gender Trouble&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1990), Moten’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/motenBreak.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Break&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2003), Sedgwick’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/sedgwickTF.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Touching Feeling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2003), Chun’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/chunNewMedia.pdf&quot;&gt;“Did Somebody Say New Media?”&lt;/a&gt; (2006) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/chunEnduringEphemeral.pdf&quot;&gt;“The Enduring Ephemeral”&lt;/a&gt; (2008), Doane’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/doaneIndexical.pdf&quot;&gt;“The Indexical and the Concept of Medium Specificity”&lt;/a&gt; (2007), Grosz’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/groszThing.pdf&quot;&gt;“The Thing”&lt;/a&gt; (2001), Brown’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/brownBillThing.pdf&quot;&gt;“Thing Theory”&lt;/a&gt; (2001), Appadurai’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/appaduraiThing.pdf&quot;&gt;“The Thing Itself”&lt;/a&gt; (2006), Haraway’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/harawaySituated.pdf&quot;&gt;“Situated Knowledges”&lt;/a&gt; (1988), and Barad’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/baradPP.pdf&quot;&gt;“Posthumanist Performativity”&lt;/a&gt; (2003). We also referred to work by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/debrayID.pdf&quot;&gt;Debray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/cspt/kraussVoyage.pdf&quot;&gt;Krauss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;compositions&quot;&gt;Compositions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In critical theory, an important question of media and material is how people compose theory and how those compositions (or those “works”) circulate. We usually associate critical theory with writing and language via text or words on the page. Of course, other quotidian materials, including screens, paper, ink, computers, file formats, pens, pencils, images, and word processors, may be involved, too. There’s also the fact that theory may draw from data, collections, archives, interviews, ethnography, and other historical sources. Plus, composition depends on labour, power, context, and embodied experience; people aren’t minds who write or communicate immaterially, impervious to all forces or independent of socio-economic factors (including institutional support). As such, the &lt;em&gt;everyday&lt;/em&gt; (or, if you prefer, habit) may play a central yet ignored or disavowed role in theory’s production and performance. Here are some questions along those lines. Perhaps some of them are relevant to your own practice. Again, discard and revise what you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;To what degree does the work at hand foreground its medium or material?&lt;/em&gt; Is text simply a means to convey ideas, or does it demand attention as an inscription or face (e.g., typefaces)? How are we prompted to engage it? Are we asked to look at or through it? Is it forward? Responsive? Intuitive? Many works, especially manifestos and publications such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/mediawork/index.html&quot;&gt;Mediawork Pamphlets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://vectorsjournal.org/issues/index.php?issue=7&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vectors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, experiment with typography and layout to make their arguments. Text is more like an image or even sculpture in this instance; it addresses us and resists reduction to mere container or carrier. It refuses to be flat, too. It is not abstract information: neither Doane’s medium without materiality nor Appadurai’s instrument of representation. It gives &lt;em&gt;texture&lt;/em&gt; to ideas. It is the tactile or visible stuff of writing, not Barthes’s methodological field, where we encounter Text with its upper case “T.” For Sedgwick, texture makes nonsense of dualisms such as “author or audience” and “active or passive engagement.” Texture cannot be explained away as a shape, outline, or structure, either; when we interpret texts, we must consider repetition, feelings, folds, and overlaps, too. Elsewhere, from a very different perspective, Shklovsky criticizes poetry’s dependence on prose, implying that text may defamiliarize ideas by disrupting the automation of sensual labour and interpretation (e.g., a move from recognition to vision) to highlight the creative process over the artifact or work itself. From this position, textual or graphic design is mostly insignificant; text is merely a medium to carry or rehearse a poetic form, which transcends the sensuous material of inscription, book, type, and page. &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Design in theory matters because it influences how people are invited into writing while also giving us a sense of how authors perceive or approach the arrangement, setting, texture, and enactment (or, taken together, the materiality) of their own theories. Design in theory also attends to how theory is packaged as an object for circulation and consumption.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aesthetics in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;To what degree does the work at hand privilege language or words as media?&lt;/em&gt; This issue is less about typography, design, layout, or even form and more about the use of irony, poetry, ambivalence, language games, and references. Often, theory will speak to matters indirectly or elliptically, by analogy or with scare quotes. Or, it will cook up new terms (e.g., see Haraway and Barad) that correspond with cultural formations and performances it wishes to explore or imagine. We might compare the writing style of Arendt with that of Kristeva, or Cixous with Williams, or Benjamin with Chun, or Simmel with Butler. Quite a contrast! What terms are coined and why? Which “flourishes” are fundamental to the theory expressed? When does a word or phrase mean multiple, perhaps contradictory things at once? When does a term resist definition or translation? Or, when must it be read in the original language? Ultimately, how would you describe the style of the theory or work at hand? Playful, opaque, evocative, abstract, musical, plain, pedantic, repetitive, assertive, emphatic, universal, global, situated, macro, meso, micro, nano . . . ? How does that style enact or resonate with a theory’s cultural, social, and political positions? These questions certainly depend on the design or inscription of words; however, they are mostly about how those words variously signify and refer; or, recalling Doane, how they variously point and trace. From some perspectives, such polysemy (deriving multiple meanings from the same word) exceeds its material (the word or image) through the labour of reading, speech, dialogue, performance, memory, etc. Theory demands interpretation, and that interpretation is embodied and situational: unique each time, the act of interpretation re-assembles or re-members fragments of text anew. It plays with the text, if you will (see Barthes, e.g.), and such play may be quite serious. Or, from other perspectives, lived experience necessarily escapes or resists any attempt to record, inscribe, commodify, or collect it as an object or text to be exchanged (see Appadurai on abstraction, e.g.). Here, writing will usually fail to account for the richness of embodied action and perception. Something will be lost; something will fall flat. Yet, regardless of the perspective, a representational emphasis on losses and gains, originals and copies, or authenticity and artifice inevitably faces its limits. We might instead privilege &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;correspondence&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;persistence&lt;/em&gt; across versions and performances of things (e.g., how one version speaks to or differs from another, instead of how accurately a “record” or “copy” re-presents the “source” or “original”). Here, Chun’s distinction between memory and storage is very informative. Memory is performed, not archived; it is contingent, not stable. Moten’s work on improvisation, phonography, and the transmission of materiality is also relevant. What happens between versions of texts? What persists and changes? &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Aesthetics in theory matter because they refuse to treat theory as either information that is simply sent and received or an argument that is merely delivered and deposited. Aesthetics accounts for the ambiguities, the contingencies, the performance, and even the poetry of critical work, which is social and thus never the product of authors or works alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Index in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How does the work acknowledge or point to the materials, conditions, assumptions, and routine labour upon which it relies?&lt;/em&gt; When an image or painting is examined, is it included in the work as a figure? Are captions provided? If so, then what do they include? How does the argument direct us, if at all, to archives, collections, and people? With how much detail or provenance? When does a work translate its primary sources, and into which languages? Who conducted the translation, and upon what authority? Is the work composed alone, collectively, or collaboratively? Under which names? Primary author aside, whose labour went into the work? Who edited, translated, printed, circulated, or archived it? How are the first, second, and third person used to make arguments in the work? How are readers interpellated? To what degree does the author rely on arguments from experience to point to people, events, or things? To what degree do they assume critical distance or disengagement from the people, events, or things at hand (e.g., see Haraway)? We might consider Merleau-Ponty and Benjamin on painting and images here. How do we see what they saw (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Angelus Novus&lt;/em&gt;)? How is vision embodied for them (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Denkbild&lt;/em&gt; or the use of lines and colour)? How is that vision also labour? Where is that labour located (e.g., in “flesh” or dialectical images)? Or, there’s Foucault’s archaeology, which often approaches documents and monuments in a rather abstract way (a vague pointing, if you will), premised on a custom vocabulary (e.g., “statements,” “positivities,” and “material repeatability”). Or, we have Chun’s evocative use of the Internet Wayback Machine in Figure 5: as a skeleton full of broken links and images, it evidences the ephemeral. Or, there’s Moten’s use of extensive footnotes (e.g., footnote 1, which is almost three-pages-long) as well as block quotations (e.g., of Douglass and Hartman) that consume a page or more. There’s Lorde’s critique of the master’s tools, too; it underscores not only arguments from experience but also the labour upon which academic work, patriarchy, whiteness, and feminism depend. Lorde notes how this labour is rarely acknowledged. &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The index in theory matters because it foregrounds how a given work traces and points to who and what were involved in its production; it also reminds us that we cannot inhabit the positions of who or what we read (e.g., we cannot see exactly how they see).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How does the work at hand change over time and across venues?&lt;/em&gt; How does it correspond with its initial inscription or dissemination? Are we reading an edition? A translation? A book? An article? A web page? What changes from page to screen, or from manuscript to book? Was the original work a talk? Was it a draft? Was it meant to be circulated during the person’s lifetime? How and where is it archived? In this instance, Lorde’s talks, Marx’s notebooks, and Benjamin’s theses come to mind. Many works of critical theory are treated as complete, as wholes, when they are really (always?) fragments or parts of a (life’s) work in progress. Of course, arguments and perspectives may change across an oeuvre, especially when we approach them as situated knowledge (Haraway) or as entanglements (Barad) with the unruly world of things (Appadurai). &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Change in theory matters because it highlights the historical contexts and material instabilities of what we read; from this perspective, theory is neither autonomous nor continuous, and a given work has no single source or moment of genesis&lt;/em&gt; (see Foucault, e.g.).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;objects-of-inquiry&quot;&gt;Objects of Inquiry&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fields such as media studies and media theory, media are usually “objects of inquiry”: the focus of study, the materials found in collections, the physical stuff of analysis. This already suggests that media can in fact be studied. They can be treated as content, as &lt;em&gt;research material&lt;/em&gt;. It also raises questions about how and by whom media are treated as objects: how and under what assumptions they are delimited, isolated, situated, examined, referenced, and archived. Once we start asking these questions, we must also consider how terms such as “subject” and “relation” function, too. How much control or mastery is asserted over an object of inquiry, and to what effects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Studies in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;To what degree is a theory about or affiliated with a discipline?&lt;/em&gt; Not all media studies publications overlap with critical theory. Still, many publications may work across the two fields, hence “media theory.” Some theories may be about media; consider Chun, Williams, Doane, and even Simmel here. Meanwhile, others may use media as examples in a line of inquiry; consider Butler, Barthes, Cixous, Kristeva, and Haraway here. Where these publications fall in terms of field recognition will influence how people interpret them and what audiences expect of them (e.g., who and what are cited; which terms are used, defined, and deemed familiar; and where and how “interventions” in existing research happen). &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Media studies in theory matters because it stresses how disciplinary practices and expectations shape the content, methods, discourse, alignments, and arguments at hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specificity in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How conceptual or granular is the treatment?&lt;/em&gt; Media and materials may be studied from a variety of positions, from the abstract to the particular, via distance and/or immersion, through rationalism and/or empiricism. Does the work at hand underscore an intimate familiarity with materials and their use, or does it focus largely on concepts and ideas? Perhaps it does both (see Sedgwick and Moten, e.g.)? How technical or exact does the work get (see Chun, e.g.)? What is the goal of such technical treatment? In a given theory, do the particulars of media (e.g., how they work or function) determine their status as concepts (e.g., how they are perceived or imagined), or vice versa? Perhaps the particulars are entangled with concepts in messy ways (see Barad and Haraway, e.g.)? Or, echoing Sedgwick, we could interpret concepts and particulars beside (not before, beneath, or behind) each other; to interpret them beside each other privileges positions over origins and causes. A key question, then, is &lt;em&gt;which details matter most and when&lt;/em&gt;. Overly conceptual treatments of media may bypass the importance of history, embodied experience, and material composition, while overly granular treatments of media may fetishize the technical details (e.g., code or hardware) and ignore cultural or social implications (e.g., ideology and oppression). Related issues to consider include the use of “Technology,” “Media,” “Text,” “Digital,” or “Machine” (all beginning with the upper case) when compared with the medium specificity (Doane) of, say, a film’s chemical base or a web browser’s compiling process. Are media treated in the singular or plural? Are they homogeneous? Whole? Do they determine or cause anything? Are they forces? Stuff? Elements? Here, Williams’s critique of McLuhan comes to mind. Williams accuses McLuhan of simple formalism, which renders television autonomous of specific material conditions and social practices; from a formalist perspective, technology has uniform or general effects, regardless of audience and situation. &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Specificity in theory matters because it demonstrates where authors locate the agency of materials, from the particulars of devices and mechanisms to the forms or concepts of Technology; the use of specificity tells us which details matter, for whom, and when.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How is content defined and studied?&lt;/em&gt; A significant amount of scholarly work parses materials and media from content, or the process of composition from the meaningfulness of the work. Does the theory at hand rely on such a demarcation? Is there a media/form binary? Writing/text? Technique/content? Matter/object? Labour/work? What assumptions or arguments do these demarcations afford? Which legacies of emphasis and categorization do they affirm or critique? Shklovsky’s readings of Tolstoy are pertinent in this instance. Tolstoy’s creative process and poetic devices are far more interesting than his work as artifact or content; according to Shklovsky, processes and devices are more important to the experience of art. Or, from another perspective, we might consider Grosz’s comparison between being enmeshed in and having dominion over media. Is content (i.e., our object of inquiry) something we can isolate and examine? Or is it produced through us and our scholarship, including the methodologies and technologies we use as well as the conditions in which we compose and interpret? Or, if we return to Cixous, we see that she emphasizes what women’s writing will do, not what it is. Although content matters for her argument, she stresses writing as a movement or action, which lacks and contains nothing. For Cixous, writing carries force or makes forces possible. &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Content in theory matters because it shows how or whether authors distinguish procedure and medium from the work or text, but also how much power, force, or influence they attribute to both process and product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objects in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How and under what assumptions are objects delimited?&lt;/em&gt; Critical traditions have a long history of rendering objects compliant and commodities silent. Objects are ostensibly possessed by subjects, and commodities presumably have no value prior to exchange. However, as Moten reminds us in his history of blackness and throughout his interpretations of Aunt Hester’s scream (via Douglass, Hartman, and Marx), these traditions are mistaken. More specifically, the assumption that objects are compliant and commodities are silent overlooks how both are living labour, how they are present or contained within us (see Moten on maternal/material and Kristeva on chora), and how they disrupt mastery or break communications (see Moten on the power to speak). Elsewhere, Brown reminds us that objects are not passive because, e.g., they become things when they are broken or when they no longer function according to social expectations; put this way, things are best described as relations, not stuff or substances. &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Objects in theory matter because they foreground how a given work exerts or assumes control over its material of inquiry, including how it speaks for, about, over, or with people, events, and things. How objects are defined also corresponds with how a given work historicizes material culture and lived experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How and under what assumptions are subjects delimited?&lt;/em&gt; Which objects of inquiry produce subjects (see Marx, e.g.), and vice versa? How does the work at hand speak to the particulars of lived experience? How is perception normalized, if at all? How is action or behaviour anthropomorphized, if at all? What are the subject’s default settings? Does the subject have a body? Autonomy? Control? How is the subject articulated (explicitly or not) with race, gender, sexuality, ability, language, location, and law? Do subjects change over time? Are they multiple? And how are they distinguished, if at all, from objects, environments, and other subjects? Via what sort of media and materials? Perhaps the very notion of a subject or object is abandoned for other terms, such as “thing,” “agent,” “assemblage,” “mangle,” “network,” “body,” or “relation.” If so, then to what political or social effects? Of course, Haraway and Barad immediately come to mind here. Haraway’s objectivity implies that boundaries materialize in interaction, and these boundaries are constantly shifting and producing new meanings. For both Haraway and Barad, there is no object or subject prior to interaction, and we cannot point to boundaries, either. (Or, when we do, it’s risky.) We also have Appadurai on persons and things: they are not distinct categories; things have social lives. There’s also Merleau-Ponty on flesh: beings are together and simultaneous, not neatly defined and discerned; like painting, they exist in relations that are never complete. We might read Barthes and Kristeva here, too: in the treatment of Text as a playful space, we hear very little about the embodied stuff of lived experience; on the phenomenology of abjection, we hear often about the masks, milk, bodies, and people we “thrust aside in order to live” (Kristeva 1982: 3). We could compare Marx with Simmel as well: with Marx during the 1850s, the machine (as fixed capital) possess skills and consumes like the human subject; in fact, the machine acts upon subjects and appropriates living labour. With Simmel during the early 1900s, the medium of money follows a similar pattern; it intervenes in personal life and divides this subject from that subject or object. Or finally, there’s Arendt and Grosz on the legacy of &lt;em&gt;homo faber&lt;/em&gt;: the autonomous human subject who fabricates a work from the inert matter of the world. This legacy, which corresponds with histories of colonialism and mastery, is typically premised on a subject who recognizes use value in matter and then acts (or capitalizes) on the world; however, Grosz suggests that intuitive or creative approaches to making may bypass use, mastery, and human autonomy altogether by acting with or within the world. &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Subjects in theory matter because they speak to how or whether a given work attributes agency to humans as autonomous individuals, but also to how subjects are distinguished from objects, things, events, environments, and other subjects (both human and nonhuman). Additionally, we are prompted to ask how or whether theory is written around the subject (and which subject) as its centre.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codes in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;How are media coded, and what codes do they enable?&lt;/em&gt; Some critical treatments of media (as objects of inquiry) may highlight how media operate within systems of signification. Media may be coded feminine or masculine, for example. Or, consider how Moten entangles “material” with “maternal,” or how Brown approaches coding and decoding via objects and things, respectively. Other treatments may underscore how media are sites for reproducing coherence or intelligibility. For instance, Butler notes how the sex/gender distinction is premised on a suspect generalization (or naturalization) of “the body,” which becomes a passive medium upon which gender is inscribed. And yet other treatments may privilege how media actually produce signs and enable corresponding logics. Doane’s work on film notes how indexical signs (e.g., footprints and photographs) are caused by physical connections, such as the medium of touch or light. These connections empower logics of the “trace,” where reality is grounded in the physical world (e.g., when photography or film are coded “more realistic” than novels or poetry). &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Codes in theory matter because they foreground the relationship between media and signification, from coded media to mediated codes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ephemerality in Theory&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;What cannot be verified?&lt;/em&gt; Not every treatment of media (as objects of inquiry) assumes they are permanent substances all the way down: grounded in a material substrate, stored in the archive, ready to hand as tangible devices. We might follow Chun’s enduring ephemeral and ask what’s constantly refreshed during interpretation. Or, we might recall Benjamin’s empirical mysticism, which studies the infinite through the stuff of words and things. Whatever our preference, asking what cannot be verified by media sparks related questions, such as: What can’t we point to, even when we know it happened? What can’t we inscribe or record, even if we feel or recognize it? What histories or actions escape the archive? What eludes metrics and quantification? What evokes without proof? What can’t be converted? What persists precisely because it’s not in storage? &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Ephemerality in theory matters because it proposes a materialism without the need for ground, proof, origin, or permanence; it makes room for the contingencies of knowledge and practice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;apparatuses&quot;&gt;Apparatuses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While media may be integral to the composition of theory as well as to its lines of inquiry, media may also operate as apparatuses: that is, matrices of production that cannot be reduced to particular people, words, environments, or things (see Haraway by way of Katie King). For instance, following Chun, we might study the apparatus of enduring ephemerality by examining the stuff of hard drives, web browsers, random access memory, source code, and algorithms. However, we would also need to account for the centrality of reading as an interpretive practice, together with the politics of novelty and speed, the history of writing technologies such as the memex, and cultural investments in both verifiability and trustworthy data/archives. Some of these are far more tangible or discrete than others; it is much easier to measure hard drive activity than how we read or trust things, for instance. Nevertheless, all components of such an apparatus may be considered “material” in some way, and they are collectively entangled with mechanisms of differentiation (e.g., between storage and memory) that are motivated or biased. As such, we might say that every apparatus has instruments, including abstract logics as well as tangible technologies, that mark, measure, and shape the world. Thus, apparatuses do not observe or study a pre-existing world; they help to create it. And theory is one component of this creation. &lt;strong&gt;Key point&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Apparatuses in theory matter because they produce meaning and values by simultaneously drawing boundaries (e.g., distinguishing this from that) and fostering coherence (e.g., lumping or categorizing things together). The materials of an apparatus may not be immediately present, either, and they include phenomena, words, bodies, infrastructures, and things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, then, are a few questions to consider when treating media as apparatuses in theory. From my perspective, these questions prompt us to consider the ethical and political dimensions of theory as they intertwine with aesthetics and social/cultural formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where does the work at hand locate agency, and how is agency defined?&lt;/em&gt; Is agency possessed by subjects, objects, nature, or culture? Is it relational? Can it be measured? If so, then how? How is agency linked to causality? Does it determine anything? Does it have a base or ground? If so, then what is that base or ground? How is agency imbricated, if at all, with complicity, oppression, or resistance? How does it effect change?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How does the work normalize what it studies?&lt;/em&gt; What must the work take for granted to distinguish between this and that? Who or what does the work lump together? How, if at all, does it graph or chart similarities? What ideologies or worldviews does it privilege? In what relation to race, gender, sexuality, ability, language, location, and law? What does it essentialize? Does this essentialization appear deliberate?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How does the work differentiate between who or what it studies?&lt;/em&gt; Here, we might consider the various dualisms we encounter in critical theory: subject/object, nonhuman/human, figure/ground, depth/surface, inside/outside, leisure/necessity, labour/work, new/old, nature/culture, middles/ends, man/woman, objectivity/subjectivity, black/white, ability/disability, self/other . . . the list goes on. Theory has variously addressed and criticized some of these dualisms while reifying others. In the work, what is porous, distinct, or subject to change? Under what assumptions? What logics or technologies produce the differences we observe in the work? When and for whom is difference generative? Radical? Exclusionary? Oppressive? When is it valued or ignored, and on what grounds?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How significant is repetition to the work?&lt;/em&gt; What is the role of the everyday? Of habit? Performance? How is repetition coded? How does it happen? Through language? Labour? Perception? Infrastructure? What congeals through repetition? What is its relation to automation? Creativity? Style? Necessity? Mastery? Ideology?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What, if anything, does the work render autonomous, withdrawn, closed, or disinterested?&lt;/em&gt; In the work, is everything open? Is anything outside of social interaction? Of culture? Of mediation? Of history? Of time and space? Of lived experience? Of the Text? To what extent must the work render something transcendent, immeasurable, or ephemeral to produce meaning and values? How does the unknown affect us? Make us vulnerable? Does the work at hand treat the unknown as a problem? As something to be (re)solved?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How, if at all, does the work engage notions of value?&lt;/em&gt; Is the work instrumentalist about anything? If so, then about what and why? How does it invest in pragmatism or experimentation? Equivalences? Use? Exchange? Accumulation? Creation? Action? Ideas? What is the work’s preferred economy? Does it propose a totality of production? In the last instance, what does it value most? At the expense of what and whom?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How does the work perceive?&lt;/em&gt; How does it rely on vision, touch, taste, or listening as a metaphor? As a framework? As an embodied experience? As labour? As a “cut” or “break”? How does perception differ from one subject or body to the next? Do the senses produce anything? Are they distinct? Are they active, passive, or . . . ? How are they measured or disciplined? What role do they play in the production of meaning and values? Of art and theory?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do materials speak or resist interpretation in the work?&lt;/em&gt; How generous is the interpretation? When and how do the materials assert themselves? How do they compel? What room does the work leave for history, archives, data, paradigms, or people to disrupt its methods and assumptions? When is the work certain? When does it hedge? On what does it insist? Is theory in dialogue with its media and materials? Or is it a hammer? Does it listen? Or does it explain away? Is it beside, before, beneath, or beyond what it studies?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Prototyping Texts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The tagline for this graduate seminar was, “Questioning the face value of texts. Prototyping what else they could be.” And the premise? To encourage students to learn more about literary texts by repeatedly altering them. Iterate, iterate, iterate. Make the text an image. Make it metadata. Make it ASCII. Make it a booklet. Make it a fillable form. Make it sound. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the pedagogy for “Prototyping Texts” after several years of teaching critical technical practices in digital studies. While both interesting and important, I noticed that such practices were nevertheless drawing students and me away from the content (books, art, games, film) we wanted most to engage. So I began to wonder what would happen if my digital studies courses went low-tech and design-forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One result of this shift was less debugging. Another was more attention to mediation (as an object of inquiry, if you will) and fewer concerns about knowing how to use particular tools or software. Low-tech pedagogy also opened the course material to a wonderful variety of student approaches, often driven by what they already knew or cared about. How they altered a given text, or from which angle, was mostly up to them. Danny Martin, for instance, decided to render Eugen Gomringer’s “silencio” in concrete (prototype pictured above and below). Needless to say, “make it concrete” was not on the syllabus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below I link to the course website, poster, and syllabus for “Prototyping Texts” as well as to my notes, a review (“Types of Prototypes”) I wrote for students, and two talks I gave that addressed the context and motivations for the seminar. I’ve also included the official description of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototyping Texts&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Spring 2016 and 2017 | UVic English 508 | Grad seminar for 12 students&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/508v2/&quot;&gt;course website&lt;/a&gt; (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/508v2/508syllabus.pdf&quot;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt; (PDF); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/508v2/508poster.pdf&quot;&gt;poster&lt;/a&gt; (PDF); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/508v2/notes.html&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;/typesofprototypes/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of “Types of Prototypes” (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;/blog.html#design-and-live-methods&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; at AIGA with &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/talks/aiga/&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;/blog.html#design-and-live-methods&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; at Florida State with &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/talks/fsu/&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; (HTML)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both theory and practice, this seminar brushes against four popular assumptions about digital humanities: 1) as a service to researchers, the field merely develops digital resources for online discovery and builds computational tools for end-users; it does not interpret texts or meaningfully engage with “pre-digital” traditions in literary and cultural criticism; 2) digital humanities is not concerned with the literary or aesthetic character of texts; it is a techno-solutionist byproduct of instrumentalism and big data; 3) digital humanities practitioners replace cultural perspectives with uncritical computer vision; instead of privileging irony or ambivalence, they use computers to “prove” reductive claims about literature and culture, usually through graphs and totalizing visualizations; and 4) to participate in the field, you must be fluent in computer programming, or at least be willing to treat literature and culture quantitatively; if you are not a programmer, then you are not doing digital humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our seminar meetings, we will counter these four assumptions by considering “design fictions,” which Bruce Sterling defines as “the deliberate use of diegetic prototypes to suspend disbelief about change.” Design fictions typically have a futurist bent to them. They speculate about bleeding edge technologies and emerging dynamics, or they project whiz-bang worlds seemingly ripped from films such as Minority Report. But we’ll refrain from much futurism. Instead, we will use technologies to look backwards and prototype versions of texts that facilitate interpretative practice. Inspired by Kari Kraus’s conjectural criticism, Fred Moten’s second iconicity, Bethany Nowviskie and Johanna Drucker’s speculative computing, Karen Barad’s notion of diffraction, Jeffrey Schnapp’s small data, Anne Balsamo’s hermeneutic reverse-engineering, and deformations by Lisa Samuels, Jerome McGann, and Mark Sample, we will conduct “what if” analyses of texts already at hand, in electronic format (e.g., page images in a library’s digital collections).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing so will involve something peculiar: interpreting our primary sources by altering them. We’ll substitute words, change formats, rearrange poems, remediate manifestos, create forms, bend data, and build bots. To be sure, such approaches have vexed legacies in the arts and humanities. Consider cut-ups, constrained writing, story-making machines, exquisite corpses, remixes, tactical media, Fluxkits, or détournement. Today, these avant-garde traditions are ubiquitous in a banal or depoliticized form, the default features of algorithmic culture and social networks. But we will refresh them, with a difference, by integrating our alterations into criticism and prompting questions about the composition of art and history today.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fabrication + Creation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014-15, I collaborated with visual artist, Nicole Clouston, on arts and humanities approaches to digital fabrication. From a materials design perspective, we studied  numerous techniques involving both additive manufacturing (3D printing) and subtractive manufacturing (cutting, etching, engraving, milling, and routing). Then we outlined their relevance to the processes of prototyping, archiving, and assembly as well as to issues such as distribution, maintenance, and aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published that work as a chapter titled “Fabrication and Research-Creation in the Arts and Humanities” in &lt;em&gt;Doing Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Constance Crompton et al. While the chapter is not open access, below are links to the book (available in paperback, hardback, and ebook formats), Nicole’s website, a related &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt; course on “Physical Computing and Fabrication,” the MLab’s project page for fabrication research, a 2014 environmental scan conducted by the MLab of digital fabrication labs in Canada and the U.S., and a 2013 talk I gave on the topic of computer vision and fabrication in the humanities. After all the links, I’ve also included the first paragraph of the chapter. The image below, of Gustave Trouvé’s “L. Bienfait” signature from the MLab’s &lt;a href=&quot;/jewelry&quot;&gt;Early Wearables&lt;/a&gt; project, was made by Danielle Morgan using a laser cutter. Many thanks to Nicole, Danielle, and Katherine Goertz for collaborating with me on this research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick scan of digital fabrication research across the academy suggests that computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) is most common in mechanical engineering, architecture, design, and urban planning departments (Goertz and Morgan 2014: n. pag.). For two examples among many, consider Taubman College’s Digital Fab Lab at the University of Michigan and the John H. Daniels Faculty Fab Lab at the University of Toronto. Inspired by Neil Gershenfeld’s groundbreaking work at MIT (2005), digital fabrication — or the creation of digital models in tactile form using additive or subtractive computer numerical control (CNC) techniques — appeals to practitioners in these fields because it tightens the loop between screen and prototype, code and material, idea and object. It also allows those practitioners to better anticipate surprises, reduce error in the manufacturing process, and rapidly test their ideas before projects are delivered for small-or large-batch production. But, aside from a few recent publications (e.g. Elliott et al. 2012 and Kee 2014), very little attention has been paid to the relevance of CAM techniques to arts and humanities research. In response to such a lack, below we walk readers through the particulars of digital fabrication, with an emphasis on materials design, digital/analog convergence, and manufacturing techniques such as 3-D printing, cutting, etching, routing, and milling. Ultimately, our aim is to demystify digital fabrication for researchers who are new to it, giving them a granular sense of computer-aided manufacturing before they start a lab, acquire equipment and materials, commit to a specific technique, or even write about it from a critical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Critical Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://hastac2016.org/&quot;&gt;HASTAC 2016&lt;/a&gt; (Arizona State University), Kim Knight, Padmini Ray Murray, Jacque Wernimont, and I discussed the relationship between design and critique–or &lt;a href=&quot;https://maker.uvic.ca/hastac16/&quot;&gt;“critical design and deviant critique”&lt;/a&gt;–in a humanities context. During our session, we asked questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the humanities, what are the settings of interpretation? How does design allow us to rethink the normalization of scenarios as well as “the user”? In this case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sarahendren.com/&quot;&gt;Sara Hendren’s work&lt;/a&gt; on accessible architecture is compelling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is interpretation embodied and situated in time and space? How does design help us attend to the particulars of situations, especially to the particulars that matter or make a difference? Here, we repeatedly drew from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukeupress.edu/meeting-the-universe-halfway&quot;&gt;Karen Barad’s work&lt;/a&gt; on mattering and boundary-making practices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does a given design value or reify, and who does it exclude? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters&quot;&gt;Simone Browne’s recent work&lt;/a&gt; on surveillance technologies is very informative here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is design also inquiry, or not simply an instrumental means to an end? Here, we considered work by &lt;a href=&quot;https://carldisalvo.com/&quot;&gt;Carl DiSalvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danielarosner.com/&quot;&gt;Daniela Rosner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/speculative-everything&quot;&gt;Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How are projects designed to be maintained and repaired over time? Which design methods frustrate “make or break” models premised on innovation above all else? In this instance, we might visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/repair/index.html&quot;&gt;“Reclaiming Repair”&lt;/a&gt; project by Lara Houston, Steven Jackson, and Daniela Rosner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How might humanities projects start with design instead of ending with it? That is, how is design much more than the “polish” we apply to surfaces immediately prior to publication or release? Here, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukeupress.edu/designing-culture&quot;&gt;Anne Balsamo’s work&lt;/a&gt; on design and culture is key.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How might we design contexts for interpretation, not just stuff or objects? The book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo8920656.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Context Providers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Margot Lovejoy, Christiane Paul, and Victoria Vesna, prompted this question in particular.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, how might design foster deviance in interpretation, or expose and experiment with norms in a material or affective way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my portion of the discussion, I outlined a critical design approach through six points, each grounded in &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt; research:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design as an attribution practice&lt;/strong&gt;, which attends to the intricacies and specificities of labor. For instance, in the MLab we often use patents and illustrations to prototype early technologies in 3-D. However, patents very rarely give attribution to people who ultimately maintain or develop the technologies at hand. To what degree can design highlight those missing names today? Or how can it prompt people to consider important differences between labor now and labor then?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design as inquiry&lt;/strong&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://danielarosner.com/&quot;&gt;Rosner&lt;/a&gt;), where we develop scenarios for interpretation, not replicas of historical objects. When the MLab tells people we’re prototyping the past, they tend to assume we’re making exact reproductions for display and circulation. However, we’re not invested in copies. We’re interested in treating design like writing, archival research, and trial-and-error experimentation, among other techniques. The results manifest as arguments about the past, not re-presentations of history. How, then, might design resist tendencies to treat objects that look historical as historical reconstructions?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design for experience&lt;/strong&gt; (as opposed to form) without “users,” but with people who are negotiating with materials—testing, twisting, bending, altering, misusing, repurposing, glitching, and critiquing what’s in circulation. Put differently, we’re leery of creating instructions for people or giving them step-by-step instructions to follow in order to assemble early technologies, in part because instructions are biased (e.g., the invisible narrator) and generally foreclose spaces for experimentation or alternatives. How do we design research so that inquiry continues through other entanglements of meaning with matter (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukeupress.edu/meeting-the-universe-halfway&quot;&gt;Barad&lt;/a&gt;), against the “receipt” of dead objects to be used, or frozen labor to be cited?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design for responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;. The very word, “prototyping,” typically elicits speculations about the future, but we can conjecture about the past, too. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindred_(novel)&quot;&gt;Butler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000069/000069.html&quot;&gt;Kraus&lt;/a&gt;.) When we do, we need design paradigms that push conjecture beyond play or “screwing around” toward responsibility: to recognize how experiments with history involve spectres of the past. Through sonification, tactile media, and collective experience, Wernimont and Stern’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://scalar.usc.edu/works/eugenic-rubicon-/index&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eugenic Rubicon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives us examples of how to engage history with such sensitivities (or sensitive data) in mind. In short, how do we design to combine entanglement with action and attention to difference?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design-in-use&lt;/strong&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drs2010.umontreal.ca/data/PDF/018.pdf&quot;&gt;Botero et al.&lt;/a&gt;), where iteration and frequent testing across settings eclipse prototyping in the abstract toward some ideal form. When it calls itself “critical,” this approach to design interrogates norms, including how technologies shape experience and proliferate values. Such norms emerge from the privileged positions and embodied habits of designers, together with the default settings of technologies and spaces, and iteration may expose or rewrite them as well as commonplace orientations toward “the user.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design for diffraction&lt;/strong&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukeupress.edu/meeting-the-universe-halfway&quot;&gt;Barad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/1886-molecular-red&quot;&gt;Wark&lt;/a&gt;), where prototypes of the past do not duplicate or mirror history but instead navigate and foreground our contingent relations with material culture. The past and present are produced together, over and over again, with patterns and change. Following Wark’s language (see pages 158-165 of &lt;em&gt;Molecular Red&lt;/em&gt;), we might say that prototyping the past does not prototype the objects of history; it prototypes processes of knowledge with an emphasis on the apparatus of knowledge production. How might design focus on the physical arrangements and phenomena that distinguish process from product, observer from observation, or this sensation from that one—on the matter, meanings, and practices that, in short, make boundaries?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you find these points and questions to be useful in your own work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Electro-Mobile Jewelry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Early Wearables Kit is the first volume in the &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt;’s “Kits for Cultural History” series. It prompts people to reverse-engineer and reassemble an electro-mobile skull stick-pin intended for cravats, designed by Gustave Trouvé, built by Auguste-Germain Cadet-Picard, and exhibited at the &lt;em&gt;Exposition universelle&lt;/em&gt; in Paris in 1867. Powered by a 1.5-volt zinc-carbon battery located in the wearer’s pocket, the skull on the pin was said to snap its jaws and move its eyes. To activate the battery, the wearer would flip the pocket battery from a vertical to a horizontal position. Once activated, the battery would trigger a mechanism resembling that of an interrupter bell hidden inside the skull, which was less than two centimeters in diameter. This combination of electricity with jewelry was not only unique for the 1860s; it also suggests the stick-pin was an early wearable technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the MLab was conducting research for the Kit, we found that only one instance of this stick-pin exists in a memory institution today. It’s at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O115814/stick-pin-cadet-picard-auguste/&quot;&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum in London&lt;/a&gt;; however, it cannot be accessed (used or tested), and it is not accompanied by the original battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a significant amount of research, including archival work and prototyping, we wondered if the skull was (as claimed) ever fully automated. Which aspects of the stick-pin’s history were hyperbole or fiction, and what might we learn from the centrality of such storytelling? So, in the end, we submitted our curiosity, suspicions, Kit, and repository (see below) for the purposes of conjectural manufacture: a combination of critical distance from early wearable culture with immersion in the particulars of the pin’s design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are descriptions of the Early Wearables Kit, some acknowledgments, and a README written by the MLab that shares instructions for the electro-mobile jewelry prototype. I also link to a downloadable repository for the Kit, another downloadable repo (with 200+ images) of Trouvé’s many designs (in the original French and also translated into English), a description of the Kit on exhibition at Rutgers in 2015, and talks and essays I wrote about early wearables and prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This repository contains files for the “Early Wearables Kit” made by the Maker Lab in the Humanities (MLab) at the University of Victoria (&lt;a href=&quot;http://maker.uvic.ca/&quot;&gt;maker.uvic.ca&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Early Wearables Kit includes 3-D models for an 1867 electro-mobile skull stick-pin designed by Gustave Trouvé and built by Auguste-Germain Cadet-Picard, historical illustrations for contextualizing the pin, a guide for interpreting its production, instructions for assembling a prototype of it, and a box for storing, arranging, and circulating the Kit’s components in tactile form. The Kit also includes references for further reading, photographs of its public exhibition, metadata for all illustrations, and abstracts for essays published by the MLab about early wearables and rapid prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wearables Kit is Volume 1 in the MLab’s Kits for Cultural History series. It was made with support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund (BCKDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/largeScaleRepresentationOfRabbitBirdAndSkullElectroMobileJewelry.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Electro-mobile Pins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/earlyWearablesKit/tree/master/history&quot;&gt;history folder&lt;/a&gt; contains various historical images related to the electro-mobile skull stick-pin. These images include illustrations of the pin as well as illustrations of related designs by Trouvé. For the Kit, the MLab prints these images and places them in the bottom compartments of the box. Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) and Bibliographic Ontology metadata are provided for each image in XML and RDF formats. Where necessary, this metadata translates the original French into English. For more illustrations of Trouvé’s work, see the MLab’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/trouve&quot;&gt;trouve&lt;/a&gt; repository, which contains 200+ images extracted from George Barral’s 1891 Trouvé biography (public domain). The MLab translated the captions for each image from the original French into English. It should be noted that, for many of his illustrations, Trouvé would sign his name, “L. Bienfait.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skull&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/skullAssembly.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Skull Assembly&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/earlyWearablesKit/tree/master/skull&quot;&gt;skull folder&lt;/a&gt; contains 3-D models for each component of the skull as both object (OBJ) and stereolithography (STL) files. For its research, the MLab feeds these models to CAD software, 3-D printers, milling machines, and routers. During our research, we prototyped the skull in acrylic, partly because of the material’s translucence. (The original skull was made of gold and enamel with diamond sparks.) For the purposes of testing, acrylic is relatively durable. Since the original skull is quite small and difficult to prototype at scale, one of the MLab’s first prototypes was hand-carved from basswood at approximately fifty times the size of the original and then digitized using a structured-light 3-D scanner. As a digital model, the skull was easier to manipulate and edit prior to fabrication. The models for that hand-carved skull are included in this repository. The skull folder also contains process documentation (JPG and PDF) exhibiting how the MLab prototyped the skull over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/haveFun.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Mechanisms for the Wearable&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/earlyWearablesKit/tree/master/mechanism&quot;&gt;mechanism folder&lt;/a&gt; contains images detailing how the mechanism (resembling a nineteenth-century &lt;a href=&quot;/images/posts/interrupterBell.gif&quot;&gt;“interrupter bell”&lt;/a&gt; used in telegraph sounders) may have animated the jaw and eyes. From the MLab’s perspective, the mechanism is the most complex and conjectural component of the prototype. While it resembles an electric bell from the period, it is also much smaller. Materials, such as small pieces of soft iron core, for these bell mechanisms are not readily available today. As an alternative to the electric bell, the MLab experimented with a solenoid. Images for these experiments are included in the folder, and video demonstrating the solenoid and telegraph sounder is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/113746979&quot;&gt;vimeo.com/113746979&lt;/a&gt;. With these images, the mechanism folder includes CorelDRAW (CDR) files and photographs for making a pocket battery container. The folder also includes process documentation (in poster form) of how the MLab prototyped the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/boxUnpacked.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Early Wearable Box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/earlyWearablesKit/tree/master/box&quot;&gt;box folder&lt;/a&gt; contains CorelDRAW (CDR) and Adobe Illustrator (AI) files for making a container in which to store, arrange, and circulate the Wearables Kit. This box can be etched with Gustave Trouvé’s signature (“L. Bienfait”), and it contains dividers, compartments, a drawer, and a calling card. For prototyping and circulation, the MLab used a laser cutter to make the box out of Baltic birch. Conceptually, the box is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fondazionebonotto.org/it/search?search=fluxus&amp;amp;collezione=&amp;amp;categoria=&amp;amp;submit=Ricerca&quot;&gt;Fluxkits&lt;/a&gt; made during the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s. Images of these box prototypes are included in the folder, which also contains process documentation (in poster form) of how the MLab developed the box from sketch to tactile container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/frontispieceTitlePage.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Early Wearables Guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/earlyWearablesKit/tree/master/guide&quot;&gt;guide folder&lt;/a&gt; contains four versions of a guide for contextualizing, interpreting, and assembling the skull stick-pin. For viewing the page spread of the guide, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/earlyWearablesKit/tree/master/guide/pageSpreadView&quot;&gt;pageSpreadView&lt;/a&gt; subfolder. This view is best for reading the guide on screen, in PDF or JPG format. To print the guide, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/earlyWearablesKit/tree/master/guide/sheetsView&quot;&gt;sheetsView&lt;/a&gt; subfolder. The MLab prints the guide in black and white and then either stitches the pages together or fastens them with ribbon or string. For viewing the individual pages of the illustrated guide, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/earlyWearablesKit/tree/master/guide/pageImages&quot;&gt;pageImages&lt;/a&gt; subfolder. Finally, for raw text, see the TXT files. The guide includes instructions for assembly (starring Trouvé himself); however, these instructions are conjectural, prompting audiences to question them or fill in the gaps (in part because the MLab cannot know for certain how the skull stick-pin was made). Inspired by present-day zines, the guide also draws upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://drc.usask.ca/projects/archbook/grangerizing.php&quot;&gt;grangerized books&lt;/a&gt; from the 1800s. Specifically, it grangerizes George Barral’s 1891 biography of Trouvé. The guide includes historical information and is structured by keywords for interpreting the stick-pin as an early wearable. Echoing the work of Raymond Williams, these keywords are: “class,” “electromagnets,” “gender,” “miniature,” “mourning,” “orientalism,” and “performance.” While these keywords give the stick-pin dimension as a cultural object, they afford conflicting interpretations of it. Against nostalgia and fetishization, they are also meant to highlight how the stick-pin was and remains entangled with values. The folder includes process documentation (in poster form) of how the MLab prototyped the guide over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/hyperrhiz2015.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hyperrhiz Publication&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/earlyWearablesKit/tree/master/essays&quot;&gt;essays folder&lt;/a&gt; includes abstracts for journal articles containing material about the Early Wearables Kit in particular or the Kits for Cultural History project in general. “Kits for Cultural History, or Fluxkits for Scholarly Communication” (&lt;em&gt;Hyperrhiz&lt;/em&gt;, Issue 13, 2015) outlines the relationship between the Kits and Fluxkits, with an emphasis on design and tacit knowledge. “Prototyping the Past” (&lt;em&gt;Visible Language&lt;/em&gt;, 2015) details a method for prototyping media history and then unpacks the Early Wearables Kit as an example. Expanding the admittedly brief interpretations in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uvicmakerlab/earlyWearablesKit/tree/master/guide&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;, this article contains significant historical information about the skull stick-pin, together with a theoretical framework for rapid prototyping in a media studies context. Finally, “Why Fabricate?” (&lt;em&gt;Scholarly and Research Communication&lt;/em&gt;, Issue 6.3, 2015) offers four reasons why humanities practitioners may wish to fabricate tactile objects for their research. Where possible, these essays are included in their entirety in PDF or HTML format.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dropping the Digital</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009 (when I was a grad student), I started writing about the various ways in which the word “digital” is value-laden. What power does it have? How does it act or behave in particular contexts? What’s implied by it? That is, what goes unsaid when it’s used? And, most interesting, what happens when it’s “dropped” or removed from a sentence? How does its removal shape interpretation and even “ruin” the significance of an argument?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied this analysis to four chapters in the first volume (2012) of &lt;em&gt;Debates in the Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Matt Gold, and published it as an essay in the second volume (2016), edited by Gold and Lauren Klein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below’s a link to that essay, titled “Dropping the Digital.” I’ve also included the first two paragraphs of it and pointed to a 2012 talk and 2018 interview where I discussed it. The second volume of &lt;em&gt;Debates&lt;/em&gt; is available online (open access) and in paperback, library cloth, and ebook formats, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following paragraphs, I “ruin” digital humanities in order to isolate what makes them distinct or compelling in the first place. Ruination is a technique whereby a text is procedurally manipulated to render it less persuasive. The manipulated text is interpreted alongside the original, and key differences between the two versions are analyzed. Informed by a long legacy of text manipulation, including work by OuLiPo, Brion Gysin, Kathy Acker, Tom Phillips, Lisa Samuels, Jerome McGann, Mark Sample, Stephen Ramsay, and—most relevant here—Kari Kraus, I consider ruination’s conjectural exercises. Borrowing from Kraus’s “Conjectural Criticism,” we might say ruinations are “concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction (as well as retrodiction)” (Kraus, ¶4). They facilitate “knowledge about what might have been or could be or almost was,” with a bias toward possibility rather than demonstrability or empiricism (¶5). Ruinations point to possible trajectories without fully illuminating them, and they insinuate that the stuff of digital humanities has been insufficiently identified and described. They also underscore how digital humanities may differ from other strains of humanities and—most important—ask what else digital humanities could be, or should do, or might at least consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this argument, my particular ruination technique is “dropping the digital,” where I remove the word “digital” from a sentence in order to examine how its absence shapes meaning and interpretation. My source material for ruination is the 2012 edition of &lt;em&gt;Debates in the Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt; (edited by Matthew K. Gold). Not only is this collection of essays rife with persuasive writing and argumentation, it also begs for additional attention to how the word “digital” is used to qualify humanities research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the rest of the essay &lt;a href=&quot;https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/f29056aa-c434-4322-a185-009e0f7e3a9d#ch37&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/debates-in-the-digital-humanities-2016&quot;&gt;print&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Phys Comp + Fabrication</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the summers of 2013-16, the &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt; taught a week-long “Physical Computing and Fabrication” course at the University of Victoria. We introduced students to a variety of prototyping techniques involving microcontrollers, 3D scanning, photogrammetry, 3D modeling, everyday materials (e.g., cardboard and paper), and additive and subtractive manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Devon Elliott, Bill Turkel, and I facilitated a class that not only experimented with different microcontrollers but also built a 3D printer. In 2014, the three of us shifted gears a bit, encouraging students to build another 3D printer, experiment with MaxMSP for interactive exhibits, and emulate early videogames to be installed and played in their original arcade cabinets. In 2015, Nina Belojevic and Shaun Macpherson joined Devon and me to design a week-long session around the theme of “metaphors in a box.” Students in that class experimented with laser-cutting, microcontrollers, 3D (SketchUp), and photo-stitching (Agisoft Photoscan). Finally, in 2016, Tiffany Chan, Danielle Morgan, Katherine Goertz, and I conducted workshops on Arduino, Agisoft Photoscan, 3D structured-light scanning, 123D Design, and 123D Make in the class. Near the end of the week, students explored how they could use these tools to develop their own projects. Of all the iterations of “Physical Computing and Fabrication,” the 2016 offering was the most thoroughly documented, with notes and instructions for each workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are links to the 2015 and 2016 course sites (including notes and instructions), which are also archived as  compressed folders. I also point to the MLab project page for “Physical Computing and Fabrication” and to photos from 2013, 2015, and 2016. After the links, I include course descriptions for 2015 and 2016. Many thanks to Nina, Tiffany, Devon, Kat, Shaun, Danielle, and Bill for teaching this course with me. It was always lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course was sponsored by the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, where I taught pedagogy, physical computing, and fabrication between 2012 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015, “Prototyping a Box: Material + Metaphor”: Throughout the week, we will survey physical computing and digital fabrication techniques by modelling, fabricating, programming, and repurposing boxes as both bits and atoms, materials and metaphors. We will consider how boxes serve multiple, often contradictory, functions. They are containers. They house computers and electronics. They frequently render their contents invisible. They are sculptures. They are conversation pieces. They can even be art objects. During the course, you will have the opportunity to prototype your own box and explain how it operates as both a material and a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2016, “From This to That”: Throughout the week, we will survey physical computing and digital fabrication techniques by modelling, fabricating, programming, and repurposing objects as both bits and atoms. This process of converting objects from this material into that material involves negotiations between screen media and tactile media. It also prompts attention to the relations between form and use, metaphor and matter, code and composition, surface and depth. Instead of reducing these relations to digital-analog, electronic-print, or new-old binaries, we will approach them as entanglements of history, technology, and culture, where composing or thinking with media is actually quite messy. In fact, highlighting the mess or mangle of things will nudge us to experiment with the contingencies of otherwise routine conversions (e.g., from page to screen, from bits to atoms, from atoms to bits, from idea to prototype back to idea).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Marx to Barad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I occasionally teach seminars in critical theory. This one (Fall 2016) traced notions of media and materiality from Marx to Barad. Each week, we paired theorists to see what sort of conversations would emerge. As an alternative to the seminar research paper, I asked students to write focused responses to these conversations. They then revised the responses and reflected on them to produce a portfolio by the term’s end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official description of “Media and Materiality: A Survey from Marx to Barad” is below, along with links to the course website, syllabus, and notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media and Materiality: A Survey from Marx to Barad&lt;/strong&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;
Fall 2016 | UVic CSPT 500 | Grad seminar for 12 students&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/500/&quot;&gt;course website&lt;/a&gt; (HTML); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/500/cspt500.pdf&quot;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt; (PDF); &lt;a href=&quot;/archive/syllabi/500/notes.html&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; (HTML)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, artists as well as theorists have engaged in a form of “new materialism,” where agency is understood as an entanglement of matter, media, and meaning. One effect is a refusal to reduce matter or media to a static state. Like language, materiality is dynamic, even if it is rarely perceived or described as such. Another effect is to rethink where we locate intent or how we think about causality in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informed by new materialism, this seminar surveys critical theory from Karl Marx to Karen Barad to identify historical stress points in the articulation of media and materiality since the 1850s. Our survey will account for how these two terms have been situated in various theories of agency, from historical materialism, semiotics, and symptomatic reading to media archaeology and agential realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Karen Barad’s “Posthumanist Performativity” and selections from Karl Marx’s &lt;em&gt;Grundrisse&lt;/em&gt;, we will read excerpts (10-45 pages each) of work by Arjun Appadurai, Hannah Arendt, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Bill Brown, Judith Butler, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Hélène Cixous, Régis Debray, Mary Ann Doane, Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Grosz, Donna Haraway, Rosalind E. Krauss, Julia Kristeva, Audre Lorde, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Fred Moten, Viktor Shklovsky, Georg Simmel, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Raymond Williams. I will not assume you have read or written about any of these authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach to this seminar will also not assume consensus about what exactly “media” and “materiality” are. We will instead start with a conversation about the relevance of the two terms today. What are their settings and politics? How are they intertwined with creative and critical practice? How do they operate in relation to other terms, such as ephemerality, pleasure, object, subject, interaction, justice, art, and agency? To what effects on our lived, social realities? Following this conversation, we will survey numerous publications (from Marx forward) to give the present some texture. Each week, we will discuss work by pairs of authors articulated with keywords. This approach will not follow a strict chronology (e.g., reading the oldest works first); however, history will matter. We will not treat the readings as ideas somehow detached from the particulars of situation or experience. Instead, we will interpret the texts at hand with attention to the conditions in which they were written. When time permits, we may also ground our studies in examples from areas such as experimental media, art, and design (i.e., areas where approaches to media and materiality do not manifest as essays or monographs). To this end, each week of the schedule includes a “case study” for consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we proceed, you will write (and revise) seven response papers, which will comprise a portfolio at the term’s end. By that end, you should have a granular sense of how media and materiality have changed over time (especially with respect to questions of agency), and along the way you should gain experience with writing and talking about critical theory. I also hope that seminar discussions will translate across a spectrum of scholarly work, from writing, teaching, and archival research to policy, ethnography, and media production (depending on your own methodologies and motivations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extensive experience with critical theory is not required for this seminar. I encourage you to ask for context, definitions, or explanations whenever the seminar feels as if it’s moving too quickly (or too slowly). Such gestures are especially important in courses, such as this one, that are anchored in interdisciplinary methods and conversations. We should be honest and open about what we don’t know, and we should learn from the knowledge others bring to the seminar. We should also account for what we assume or take for granted, including our biases and privileges. If you’re curious about additional material corresponding with the seminar, then feel free to contact me with requests for related reading and the like. I’m happy to chat more and point you in directions of potential interest. I’m also happy to hear recommendations, so please send them my way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prototyping the Past</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Prototyping the Past” is the title of an article as well as a line of inquiry, if not a technique, that the &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt; pursued as part of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUkCnf6DS-c&quot;&gt;“Kits for Cultural History”&lt;/a&gt; project between 2012 and 2018. The project applied prototyping, including physical computing and fabrication, to speculations about history rather than the future. We remade early technologies that no longer existed or no longer functioned. The goal was not to create exact reproductions or replicas as means to access “real history”; it was to test assumptions about old media and material records and see what surprises or findings emerged in the process. The article focuses, for the sake of example, on prototyping early wearables and electro-mobile jewelry (pictured above and below). Other examples from the MLab include early &lt;a href=&quot;/nofuture&quot;&gt;magnetic recording&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/optophone&quot;&gt;optophonics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a link to that article (subscription required), published in late 2015 in a special issue of &lt;em&gt;Visible Language&lt;/em&gt; that was edited by Jessica Barness and Amy Papaelias. The topic of the issue is “Critical Making,” and alongside “Prototyping the Past” it includes essays by Anne Burdick; Donato Ricci, Robin de Mourat Christophe Leclercq, and Bruno Latour; Holly Willis; Tania Allen and Sara Queen; Stephen Boyd Davis and Florian Kräutli; Steve Anderson; Padmini Ray Murray and Chris Hand; and Steven McCarthy. I also provide links to the MLab’s electro-mobile jewelry prototypes, our research on early wearables, and various talks I gave on prototyping the past, all followed by an abstract and acknowledgments for the &lt;em&gt;Visible Language&lt;/em&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Jessica and Amy for their editorial work on such a timely and important issue of &lt;em&gt;Visible Language&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article outlines a methodology for combining media studies with rapid prototyping and computer numerical control (CNC) techniques premised on remaking technologies that no longer function, no longer exist, or may have only existed as fictions, illustrations, or one-offs. Called “prototyping the past,” the methodology understands technologies as entanglements of culture, materials, and design, and it explains how and why technologies matter by approaching them as representations and agents of history. Informed by hermeneutics, it refuses to take historical materials at face value. It situates media history in a particular thing and the contradictory interpretations that thing affords. It also relies upon trial-and-error negotiation across modes of 2-D and 3-D production, creating media that function simultaneously as evidence and arguments for interpreting the past. Yet most important, prototyping the past does more than re-contextualize media history in the present. It integrates that history into the social, cultural, and ethical trajectories of design. To demonstrate the methodology, I detail how the “Kits for Cultural History” project at the University of Victoria prototypes absences in the historical record and prompts audiences to examine the conditions of that record. I then dedicate my attention to one Kit in particular: the “Early Wearables Kit,” which remakes an 1867 electro-mobile jewelry piece from Paris. After interpreting the Early Wearables Kit from three different perspectives, I articulate eight ways to understand prototyping and media history together, with an emphasis on how prototyping the past stresses the contingent relations between matter and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Audio Cultures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I first taught audio in 2007, as part of an English composition course at the University of Washington (UW). Now, over ten years later, I frequently include it in my courses at UVic. Students and I experiment with listening techniques, such as causal, semantic, reduced, and deep listening, and I encourage them to engage complex issues of mediation by writing with audio. They might, for instance, compose radio documentaries and voice-over tracks in “Audio Culture Studies,” which I’ve taught three times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to the “Audio Culture” syllabus, three prompts for writing with audio, a course playlist and poster, and an end-of-term review are below, followed by a course description. I also point to a piece on scaffolding audio assignments that I published with &lt;em&gt;Sounding Out!&lt;/em&gt; (edited by Jennifer Stoever) in 2012 as well as to a 2013 talk I gave at UBCO on working with historical audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is an interdisciplinary approach to culture by way of sound. Attending to the political as well as the aesthetic dimensions of sound, we will survey a history of audio technologies (e.g., turntables, tape, radio, and MP3s) together with the cultures in which they are embedded (e.g., remix, high fidelity, protest, and ethnography). We will address questions such as: Do we own our voices? When and why do we think sound is immediate or immersive? Why is sound often associated with emotion? Under what assumptions are sounds gendered, sexualized, or racialized? Is sound ephemeral? Is it material? Do ideologies shape how we hear the world around us? Why do people hack audio technologies or remix sounds? When is sound “authentic”? How do sonic and visual cultures intersect? How does popular culture privilege visuals? How do we think about audio and images together while also considering their differences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the semester, we will listen extensively to historical audio, study sound artists, read publications in sound studies, and examine films and advertisements. You will also practice composing in three audio genres: the radio documentary, the voice-over, and field recording. By the semester’s end, you will be expected to produce academic arguments anchored in cultural studies methodologies and also reflect on sound as a way to critically approach culture. I will assume you have no experience working with sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will likely study the work of Theodor Adorno, Laurie Anderson, Jacques Attali, Les Back, Alexander Graham Bell, Michael Bull, William S. Burroughs, John Cage, Michel Chion, Mark Cousins, Bing Crosby, DJ Shadow, DJ /rupture, DJ Spooky, Thomas Edison, Ralph Ellison, Brian Eno, Kodwo Eshun, Girl Talk, Lisa Gitelman, Grandmaster Flash, Brion Gysin, Stuart Hall, Holly Herndon, King Tubby, Kool Herc, Le Tigre, Lead Belly, John Lomax, Marshall McLuhan, Merzbow, Jack Mullin, Pauline Oliveros, John Oswald, Les Paul, Tara Rodgers, Tricia Rose, Luigi Russolo, R. Murray Schafer, Pierre Schaeffer, Jonathan Sterne, Edgard Varèse, and Alexander Weheliye.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Between Bits + Atoms</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital fabrication is often associated with printing copies or replicas; but, during the 2010s, Devon Elliott, Kari Kraus, Bethany Nowviskie, Bill Turkel, and I were curious about using it to prototype fuzzy scenarios, counterfactual histories, and possible worlds through a sort of infrastructural inversion or reflective design practice. We wrote an essay along these lines. It’s titled “Between Bits and Atoms” and was published as the first chapter in &lt;em&gt;A New Companion to Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Susan Schreibman et al.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to that essay, corresponding MLab research, and a related talk and workshop I gave in 2013 with Jeremy Boggs and Devon Elliott are below. I’ve included an abstract for the essay as well. The &lt;em&gt;New Companion&lt;/em&gt; is available online (subscription required) and in paperback, hardback, and ebook formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter argues that, in the humanities, making things with physical computing and desktop fabrication techniques encourages hands‐on, conjectural approaches to material culture, history, and preservation. Aside from detailing the technical particulars of physical computing and desktop fabrication, it explains their relevance to design, administrative, and communicative agendas in post‐secondary education. It also refers readers to several persuasive projects that blend humanities research methods with physical computing and fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Critical Making</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2015, Garnet Hertz interviewed Phoebe Sengers, Natalie Jeremijenko, Matt Ratto, Alexander Galloway, and me about the notion and practice of critical making. He transcribed each conversation, wrote an introduction, and published the project as a book with Marilouise and Arthur Kroker’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/index&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;CTheory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That book is &lt;em&gt;Conversations in Critical Making&lt;/em&gt;, and below I link to it in PDF and HTML formats (both of which are open access). I also point to a video of Hertz’s interview with me and a related keynote I gave in 2015 on “Executable Culture, Arguments with Objects.” I’ve included Hertz’s brief description of the book, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the current of disposable technology and estranged digital devices, critical making brings together individuals working at the intersection of critical thinking and hands-on practice. What follows are a series of interviews with leading theorists and practitioners of critical making. Discussions range from the political implications of critical making to creative reflections on the place of technology in culture and society.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fluxkits</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fluxkits for scholarly communication (aka kits for cultural history) are perhaps best understood as small boxes of inexpensive materials assembled for the purposes of media history. They were central to work we performed in the &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt; during the 2010s, and they were inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPi0UyHB95U&quot;&gt;Fluxkits&lt;/a&gt; made during the 1960s and ’70s by George Maciunas, Ay-O, George Brecht, Dick Higgins, Alice Hutchins, Alison Knowles, Carla Liss, Larry Miller, Nam June Paik, Mieko Shiomi, Yoshimasa Wada, Robert Watts, and other Fluxists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was to integrate the activity of construction, the practice of conjecture, and a range of sensory experiences into the conventions of the academic article, particularly articles about the inaccessible stuff of history. Drawing from the lab’s &lt;a href=&quot;/jewelry&quot;&gt;electro-mobile jewelry&lt;/a&gt; project, I published a rationale for the kits’ design and use in comparative media studies. I wrote that rationale in essay form but included with it some images, video, and files produced by other MLab researchers. The open access journal, &lt;em&gt;Hyperrhiz: New Media Cultures&lt;/em&gt;, published it all in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to the &lt;em&gt;Hyperrhiz&lt;/em&gt; piece as well as corresponding images, video, files, and research are below. I included an abstract, too, and point to some related talks I gave at Union College (2015), Cornell (2016), Washington State University (2016), and HASTAC (2016). Thanks to Nina Belojevic, Tiffany Chan, Nicole Clouston, Katherine Goertz, Shaun Macpherson, Kaitlynn McQueston, Danielle Morgan, and Victoria Murawski for conducting this research with me in the MLab. Thanks as well to Robert A. Emmons, Jr. and James J.

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project at the University of Victoria’s Maker Lab in the Humanities, the Kits for Cultural History (“Kits”) are small boxes of inexpensive materials assembled for media history. Building on the intermedia legacies of Fluxkits, they emphasize the importance of everyday experience and tacit knowledge to remembering the past. Research for the Kits focuses on technologies that are inaccessible in today’s galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. This research complicates histories framed by screens and expressed in books, asks what is missing from both, and then prototypes the absences for circulation and critique. Through this process, design becomes inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a design perspective, the Kits ask how technologies are culturally embedded, and how meaning is entangled with matter, through a sort of accidental theory: instead of starting with a program, supporting it, and ultimately proving it, the Kits present a collection of positions and parts for material investigation, which then prompts participants to attend to specific issues at the intersections of politics and aesthetics. The Kits also bypass appeals to “real history” and “exact replicas” by versioning the past. They variously articulate components to demonstrate how technologies are constructed, replete with editorial decisions, scripted with values, and subject to change and alteration over time. Ultimately, this process declares that the history at hand is incomplete, yet it also uses three-dimensional media and computer numerical control (CNC) techniques to rethink how scholarly communication happens.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Fabricate?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt; developed our research on the roles computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) may play in media history and speculative design, we also wanted to push beyond popular &lt;a href=&quot;/mtdb&quot;&gt;“maker”&lt;/a&gt; rhetoric and the allure of 3D printing as a gadget or trend. I wrote an essay to engage this issue, and in it I outlined four reasons why humanities researchers might consider fabricating tactile prototypes as part of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I titled the essay, “Why Fabricate?” Links to it, corresponding MLab / &lt;a href=&quot;/fab&quot;&gt;fab lab&lt;/a&gt; research, and related talks I gave during the 2010s are below. I’ve also included an abstract for the essay, which was published in &lt;em&gt;Scholarly and Research Communication&lt;/em&gt;. Many thanks to Nina Belojevic, Nicole Clouston, Devon Elliott, Katherine Goertz, Kari Kraus, Shaun Macpherson, Danielle Morgan, Daniela Rosner, and Bill Turkel for collaborating with me on approaches to fabrication and prototyping. Those collaborations have been a highlight of my academic career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the assumption that humanities research frequently renders three-dimensional objects two-dimensional for the sake of reference and communication, this essay articulates four research areas where humanities practitioners may wish to fabricate tactile objects as part of their work: 1) data physicalization, 2) remaking old technologies, 3) cultural studies of negotiated endurance, and 4) infrastructure studies by way of shared social concerns (as opposed to shared technical specifications). These four research areas are anchored in ongoing examinations of both the technical and cultural dimensions of digital fabrication, including methods for additive and subtractive manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Technology (A Keyword)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The work of Raymond Williams, including &lt;em&gt;Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture&lt;/em&gt;, has significantly shaped my own thinking, especially when I was in graduate school. I was thus quite honored when Bruce Burgett and Glenn Hendler invited me to write the entry on “Technology” for their collection, &lt;em&gt;Keywords for American Cultural Studies&lt;/em&gt;, now in its third edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to the book and entry are below. I also point to my 2018 syllabus for Technology and Society 200, “Prototyping Pasts and Futures,” where I taught &lt;em&gt;Keywords&lt;/em&gt; essays by Hendler (“Society”), Lisa Nakamura (“Media”), and Tara McPherson (“Digital”). Those links are followed by New York University Press’ official description of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Bruce and Glenn for their fabulous editorial work over the years. Their approach informed my own as I edited &lt;em&gt;Making Things and Drawing Boundaries&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt; during the 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description of &lt;em&gt;Keywords for American Cultural Studies&lt;/em&gt; (Third Edition)&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
Since its initial publication, scholars and students alike have turned to &lt;em&gt;Keywords for American Cultural Studies&lt;/em&gt; as an invaluable resource for understanding key terms and debates in the fields of American studies and cultural studies. As scholarship has continued to evolve, this revised and expanded third edition offers indispensable meditations on new and developing concepts used in American studies, cultural studies, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed as a uniquely print-digital hybrid publication, this &lt;em&gt;Keywords&lt;/em&gt; volume collects 114 essays, each focused on a single term such as “America,” “culture,” “diversity,” or “religion.” More than forty of the essays have been significantly revised for this new edition, and there are nineteen completely new keywords, including crucial additions such as “biopolitics,” “data,” “debt,” and “intersectionality.” Throughout the volume, interdisciplinary scholars explore these terms and others as nodal points in many of today’s most dynamic and vexed discussions of political and social life, both inside and outside of the academy. The &lt;em&gt;Keywords&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; features forty-eight essays not in the print volume; it also provides pedagogical tools for instructors using print and online keywords in their courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication brings together essays by interdisciplinary scholars working in literary studies and political economy, cultural anthropology and ethnic studies, African American history and performance studies, gender studies and political theory. Some entries are explicitly argumentative; others are more descriptive. All are clear, challenging, and critically engaged. As a whole, &lt;em&gt;Keywords for American Cultural Studies&lt;/em&gt; provides an accessible A-to-Z survey of prevailing academic buzzwords and a flexible tool for carving out new areas of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Fab Lab</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I collaborated with Paul Walde and the Department of Visual Arts during the mid-2010s to establish a Digital Fabrication Lab (DFL) at UVic with support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund. Paul and I were successful with a launch in 2015, and the DFL’s been operating in UVic’s Visual Arts Building since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt; often used the DFL to manufacture 3D models and prototypes in (usually discarded or scrap) materials such as wood, paper, cardboard, and foam. The DFL’s now used by a broader group of students, staff, and faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an excerpt of a 2015 UVic news article, where John Threlfall and the Faculty of Fine Arts officially announce the Digital Fabrication Lab. I also point to the DFL’s website, the MLab’s inventory, related MLab posts and research (including a 2014 environmental scan of digital fabrication sites on U.S. and Canadian university campuses), and a talk I gave in 2015 at the BC Library Conference on the DFL’s infrastructure. Thanks to Paul, John, Cliff Haman, Hollis Roberts, Margaret Cameron, and everyone across Fine Arts and the Humanities at UVic who helped to make the DFL happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund, and UVic’s Faculty of Humanities, Faculty of Fine Arts, Department of English, and Department of Visual Arts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“UVic’s Digital Fabrication Lab the first of its kind in North America,”&lt;/strong&gt; by John Threlfall on 13 July 2015 | excerpt | read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://finearts.uvic.ca/research/blog/2015/07/13/uvics-digital-fabrication-lab-the-first-of-its-kind-in-north-america/&quot;&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UVic is once again leading the pack with the creation of the Digital Fabrication Lab (DFL). A collaboration between the Department of Visual Arts and the preexisting Maker Lab in UVic’s Electronic Textual Cultures Lab, the DFL is the first of its kind to encompass the arts and humanities in North America. Additionally, no university or college in North America yet has a computer numerical control (CNC) lab in the humanities, meaning the DFL is the first humanities facility of its kind on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are far-reaching effects for this type of technology in just about everything we do,” says Department of Visual Arts chair Paul Walde. “Photography was the first area where there was almost a complete paradigm shift towards digital, and we’re now seeing digital technology move into every aspect of visual arts production. This represents a way for us to move forward not only with new sculptural techniques and projects but also printmaking and even certain kinds of painting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFL will include CNC routers, an industrial grade 3D scanner, a laser cutter, a milling machine, and 3D printers, together with various machining tools. “Visual Arts is a leader in material practices and material culture,” says Walde, who notes they already have extensive workshops and the necessary support staff to expand into this area. “We have purpose-built facilities for the safe handling and research of these applications. It’s a perfect fit for us . . . it’s an investment in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maker Lab at UVic, housed in the Technology Enterprise Facility, is a collaborative space of new techniques and old technologies involving the invention of imaginative and often outsized revisions of objects that don’t always exist in the world. Because its research is innovative, multi-faceted and occasionally intangible, it does not easily fit a simple definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lab is inspired by experimental art, design and D.I.Y. cultures. The inter-disciplinary research team from UVic English, CSPT and Visual Arts includes faculty as well as undergraduate and graduate students who use physical computing and digital fabrication for cultural research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lab was launched in September 2012, under the leadership of director Dr. Jentery Sayers, an assistant professor, English and CSPT, with funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada Foundation for Innovation and the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sayers describes the Maker Lab as an “intersection of cultural criticism and comparative media studies with computation, prototyping, electronics and experimental methods. Its design is anchored in blending a humanities research lab with a makerspace–a design that affords its team of students and faculty opportunities to build projects through various modes of ‘knowing by doing,’ such as programming, markup, new media production, data modeling, 3D printing and circuit design.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lab’s research will ultimately “inform policies on the ethics, distribution, licensing and derivation of 3D objects,” says Sayers, policies which currently do not exist in Canada. The lab also trains students in physical computing and desktop fabrication in non-STEM fields. Sayers points out that fabrication and physical computing are popular in STEM fields, but are virtually unknown in the humanities. . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m very excited about it,” says Walde about the DFL and this new Visual Arts collaboration with Humanities. “I can’t wait to see what the possibilities are with this equipment. That’s usually what gets the imagination stirring.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Architecture as Catalyst</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015, I had the honor of being a guest instructor at the University of Minnesota, where I co-taught a week-long intensive course on “Reading Façades: Integrating Human and Computer Vision” with Andrea Johnson in the School of Architecture. The course was part of the College of Design’s “Architecture as Catalyst” series, and Johnson and I led workshops on blending manual and automated approaches to the capacious notion of a “façade.” Graduate students experimented mostly with photogrammetry techniques to model an array of façades on Minnesota’s campus, including the façades of the Weisman Art Museum, Pillsbury and Rapson Halls, Coffman Memorial Union, and McNamara Alumni Center. Some techniques aimed for fidelity, while others privileged the traversal and production of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More educators and practitioners joined me that week to teach their own Catalyst courses: Leah Beuchley (designer and engineer) on ephemeral façades and resilience, Doris Kim Sung (biologist, architect, and USC professor of architecture) on living surfaces and building envelopes, Hideyuki Nakayama (architect) on architecture of the mask, Omar Gandhi (architect) on water and architectural form, and Ian Harris (architectural cinematographer) on architectural filmmaking. Each of us also gave a public talk while we were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A link to the syllabus for “Reading Façades” is below. I also point to course documentation, student work, Minnesota’s official pages for the “Architecture as Catalyst” series, material from my Catalyst talk, and recordings of all guest instructor talks. After that appear descriptions of both the Catalyst series and “Reading Façades.” Many thanks to Andrea for inviting me and then teaching with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course was sponsored by University of Minnesota’s College of Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecture as Catalyst&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Architecture as Catalyst is an annual week-long event, bringing new ideas, conversations, and expertise to the school by inviting guests from around the world to run experimental workshops with graduate students and give public lectures on their work. Each year, the week before spring break, first and second year graduate architecture students engage with the guests and host faculty in intensive five-day workshops, each focused around a unique set of ideas and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of Catalyst is to raise the level of discourse about design and to provoke leaps in perception of what design can be. The workshops serve as intense, rigorous, transformative and creative sparks within the spring semester, and participants then re-engage their peer groups able to share new ways of thinking, communicating and making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catalyst guests have ranged from experienced educators to practitioners to artists, both within and outside the discipline of architecture. Workshops span a wide field of topics, such as parametric modeling, digital fabrication, smart materials, sensory objects, food science, filmmaking, sound recording, book arts, stereotomy, and photogrammetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Reading Façades: Integrating Human and Computer Vision”&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;
Guest Instructor: Jentery Sayers, University of Victoria &lt;br /&gt;
Faculty Instructor: Andrea J. Johnson, AIA, LEED BD+C, UMN School of Architecture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the emergence of computer vision, or machine phenomenology, inform our interpretations of the built environment? How can the face or exterior of a building be detected, organized, and understood? Instead of approaching human and computer vision in a binary fashion, how might they be blended to ask questions about society, technology, and design? In this workshop, we will combine image capture, Python programming, and physical computing techniques with object‐detection frameworks in order to not only expand existing perceptions of built environments but also consider the relevance of computer vision to building facade design, archiving, and analysis. Here, the affordances of computer vision to systematically, superficially, and rapidly detect, describe, and model 3D objects will prove informative. These affordances will be combined with critical studies of algorithms and computational culture. Students will participate in hands‐on, introductory workshops on Python, photogrammetry, image processing, machine learning, and physical computing. No previous experience in these areas will be assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer Vision: methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Object Recognition: task of finding and identifying objects in an image or video sequence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Machine Learning: algorithms that can learn from data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Photogrammetry: taking measurements from photos to determine locations of surface points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical Computing: interactive physical systems using software and hardware that can sense and respond to the analog world&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Python Programming: an open‐source, high‐level, easy to learn programming language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Arguing with Computers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Between 2013 and 2018, I focused a chunk of my teaching on computation as a form of mediation, encouraging students to make arguments about literature, history, and culture without relying much on what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interfaces. One goal of this particular angle was to build knowledge around tool-agnostic practices and oft-ignored processes that typically shape humanities work with computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early iterations of that angle, epitomized by a graduate seminar I called “Arguing with Computers,” were rather technical. Students, most of whom were new to computational methods, surveyed the basics of the command line, text editors, programming languages like R and Python, converters such as Pandoc, libraries including OpenCV, and techniques for tracking changes, retrieving and scraping content, recognizing patterns, attributing content to authors and characters, scanning images, creating bots, and preserving websites. Along the way, we also discussed keywords and debates in media studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Arguing with Computers” was a lot. Too much, in fact. Curiosity about new methods was quickly dampened by routine frustrations with the machines in front of us, and our collective interests in literature, history, and culture were eclipsed by the desire to simply get a thing to just do its thing without error messages or debugging. We thus struggled to achieve the persuasive integration of computing with criticism to which we aspired; nonetheless, we learned a lot about critical technical practice, the default settings of popular technologies, and some common (if not pernicious) assumptions about computing that operate within humanities fields and disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to the Spring 2015 website and student abstracts for “Arguing with Computers” are below. I also point to related talks I gave in 2015 at the Universities of Waterloo and Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital literary studies (DLS) are frequently associated with not only the interpretation of literature through computational means but also an investment in how literature changes through networked culture, algorithms, and new media. For instance, Alan Liu claims that, in DLS, “everything old and new is up for grabs again,” as scholars, artists, programmers, and an array of practitioners negotiate the tensions between imagination and simulation, writing and encoding, reading and browsing, mimesis and modelling, surface and depth, publication and transmission. Since this seminar is an introduction to DLS, it gives you the opportunity to survey a variety of methods and perspectives, and it is intended for students who are absolutely new to—and even skeptical of—digital humanities. The seminar’s design assumes that digital literary studies (in particular) and digital humanities (in general) are best understood through the combination of theory with practice. Such an assumption means that we will blend knowing and doing, resisting the prevalent-but-fallacious divides between techniques and concepts as well as intellectual and physical labour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the focus of this semester’s instantiation of English 507 is “Arguing with Computers,” which, as you might guess, is meant to be multivalent. First, it underscores the fact that we will be using computers and computational methods to make claims about literature and culture. By extension, we will ask how such methods shape our understanding of the purposes and aims of literary and cultural criticism. Are computational methods more “scientific” or “objective” than non-computational ones? Are they reductive? Are they too quantitative, or ever qualitative, or potentially ambiguous? How (if at all) do they facilitate exegesis, hermeneutics, or deconstruction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these questions point to two other interpretations of “Arguing with Computers”: we will develop a healthy resistance to computational methods, and we will experience frustration with technologies and practices such as programming, encoding, and processing. What concepts, habits, and beliefs congeal within and around computers, operating systems, and their default settings? What cultural questions do computational methods foreclose or restrict? How (if at all) are the constraints of computational analysis conducive to literary critique? And how is frustration with computing and its devices at once a matter of literacy, aesthetics, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; culture? Who, indeed, gets to hack, and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, and perhaps most importantly: we will unpack how computation can be persuasively integrated into the histories and modes of literary and cultural criticism, including how we routinely interpret and perceive texts. At its core, how is computational analysis part and parcel of a longer legacy of defining mediation, of understanding reading and writing? How is human vision melded with computer vision, and under what assumptions about time, space, and labour? How do we combine existing practices in close reading, listening, and watching with emerging computational modes, such as “distant reading,” “surface reading,” pattern recognition, algorithmic criticism, web ethnography, scanning, and compiling? If these practices can actually be combined, then to what effects on English studies? That is, how (if at all) and when (if ever) do “multimodal” or human-computer approaches yield surprise for literary critics? Or tell us something new or unique about literature and culture? To be sure, we won’t produce definitive answers to all these questions. After all, there are already quite a few. However, they will pop up frequently throughout the semester, in our readings, discussions, and workshops, and I hope they spark dialogue and differences of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will engage work by the following artists and scholars, among others: Anne Balsamo, Stephen Best, Ian Bogost, Jay David Bolter, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Sharon Daniel, Mary Ann Doane, Johanna Drucker, Lori Emerson, Rita Felski, Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Alan Galey, Alexander Galloway, Alex Gil, Lisa Gitelman, Richard Grusin, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Lauren Klein, Alan Liu, Alexis Lothian, Tara McPherson, Lev Manovich, Sharon Marcus, Jerome McGann, Lisa Nakamura, Bethany Nowviskie, Amanda Phillips, Miriam Posner, Stephen Ramsay, Roopika Risam, Lisa Rhody, Stan Ruecker, Lisa Samuels, Susan Leigh Star, Jonathan Sterne, Dennis Tenen, McKenzie Wark, Jacqueline Wernimont, and Grant Wythoff.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MLA DH Forum</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was elected in 2014 to serve on the executive committee for the Modern Language Association’s Digital Humanities forum from 2015 to 2020, including service as committee chair in 2018-19. During my time on the forum, I worked to expand digital humanities to engage fields such as media studies, cultural studies, writing studies, and science and technology studies. I also helped to organize several conference sessions related to issues of digital labor and justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A link to the MLA’s complete list of forums is below, followed by the official definition and purpose of those forums. I also point to the MLA Annual Convention sessions I co-organized on behalf of the forum between 2015 and 2020. Many thanks to everyone (see below) who shared their research during those sessions and to fellow executive committee members, Cheryl Ball, Rachel Sagner Buurma, Jim English, Matt Gold, Lauren Klein, Adeline Koh, Amanda Licastro, Élika Ortega, Mark Sample, and Victoria Szabo, for collaborating with me as part of the forum’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Language Association Forums&lt;/strong&gt; (as of 6 July 2021)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Definition&lt;/em&gt;. The MLA forums encompass the scholarly and professional concerns of the association. Taken together, they provide a map—linguistic, temporal, and geographic—of the discipline of language and literature studies and of its connections to other disciplines. They do not, however, focus on individual authors (except Chaucer and Shakespeare) or groups of authors or on themes or motifs. The forums are not autonomous organizations but are an integral part of the MLA; they have no corporate identity beyond that afforded by the MLA, and they may not use the name of the association for any project or program unless specifically authorized to do so by the Executive Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose of the forums&lt;/em&gt;. Forums promote scholarly and professional activities within their areas of concern. The executive committees of the forums arrange sessions at the MLA Annual Convention, make nominations for executive committee elections (as provided below) and for the election of the forums’ representatives in the MLA Delegate Assembly, and provide information of interest to their members through association periodicals or mailings to forum members. Forums advise appropriate MLA committees on research and pedagogical needs in their fields of interest and may propose to the Executive Council projects that the association might wish to undertake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information available at the MLA’s page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mla.org/Convention/Planning-a-Convention-Session/Policies-for-Forums-and-Allied-Organizations&quot;&gt;“Policies for Forums and Allied Organizations.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Metaterials</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dan Anderson and I wrote a somewhat elliptical essay about the figurative and literal dimensions of layering in media composition. We were motivated, at least in part, by the popular tendency to present media as finished and polished products on flat screens. We were also interested in the tensions between the (dis)continuities (if not ephemerality) of media practice and the circulation of discrete snapshots and files. Dan produced a series of “metaterial” videos along the way to enact what we were doing our best to describe in writing. A lot was meant to be left blurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published the essay, titled “The Metaphor and Materiality of Layers,” in Jim Ridolfo and William Hart-Davidson’s collection, &lt;em&gt;Rhetoric and the Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt;. Links to that book, the video channel for our essay, and Dan’s website are below, followed by the official description of the collection. I also point to a related talk I gave at Syracuse in 2016. Thanks to Dan for writing with me, and to Jim and Bill for their editorial work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description of &lt;em&gt;Rhetoric and the Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;
The digital humanities is a rapidly growing field that is transforming humanities research through digital tools and resources. Researchers can now quickly trace every one of Issac Newton’s annotations, use social media to engage academic and public audiences in the interpretation of cultural texts, and visualize travel via ox cart in third-century Rome or camel caravan in ancient Egypt. Rhetorical scholars are leading the revolution by fully utilizing the digital toolbox, finding themselves at the nexus of digital innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhetoric and the Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt; is a timely, multidisciplinary collection that is the first to bridge scholarship in rhetorical studies and the digital humanities. It offers much-needed guidance on how the theories and methodologies of rhetorical studies can enhance all work in digital humanities, and vice versa. Twenty-three essays over three sections delve into connections, research methodology, and future directions in this field. Jim Ridolfo and William Hart-Davidson have assembled a broad group of more than thirty accomplished scholars. Read together, these essays represent the cutting edge of research, offering guidance that will energize and inspire future collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Peer Review Personas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The practice of networked peer review conducted in online environments continues to be a subject of critical discussion in the field of publishing. Nina Belojevic and I engaged that discussion in 2013-4 by prototyping a platform plugin called “Peer Review Personas.” Our particular approach to prototyping emerged from Nina’s previous project, &lt;em&gt;HyperLit&lt;/em&gt; (with Jon Johnson), which parodied gamification and engagement metrics by producing a playful design fiction (including wireframes and a video scenario) about “unlocking” James Joyce’s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on research by Kari Kraus, Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Jonathan Lukens, Carl DiSalvo, Alan Galey, and Stan Ruecker, Nina and I outlined how the “Peer Review Personas” prototype could help practitioners to: “1) provide a range of commentary on scholarly communications, 2) document otherwise ephemeral or overlooked labor, 3) express activity with granularity over time and across venues, 4) develop reputations in their domains of expertise as well as authority in their communities of practice, 5) collaborate with a collective of practitioners, and 6) assess the tendencies and biases of peer review in the aggregate” (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0017.304?view=text;rgn=main#top&quot;&gt;paragraph four&lt;/a&gt;). We concluded by sharing our various concerns with where the prototype could go in a world of metrics and attention economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nina and I first presented this work at New York University in 2013 and later published it as an article in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Electronic Publishing&lt;/em&gt;. Since then, I have continued to experiment with design-based approaches to networks and digital labor, and Nina’s built a career as a UX professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various links to our essay and related projects (including Nina’s website) are below, followed by an abstract for “Peer Review Personas.” Thanks to Nina for writing with me, and to Maria Bonn and Jonathan McGlone at &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Electronic Publishing&lt;/em&gt; for their feedback and editorial work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguing for the relevance of speculative prototyping to the development of any technology, this essay presents a “Peer Review Personas” prototype intended primarily for authoring and publication platforms. It walks audiences through various aspects of the prototype while also conjecturing about its cultural and social implications. Rather than situating digital scholarly communication and digital technologies in opposition to legacy procedures for review and publication, the prototype attempts to meaningfully integrate those procedures into networked environments, affording practitioners a range of choices and applications. The essay concludes with a series of considerations for further developing the prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hacking the Classroom</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Media studies and popular culture witnessed plenty of “hacking” during the 2000s and 2010s. To engage the term pedagogically, rhetorically, and politically, I collaborated with James J. Brown, Jr., Mary Hocks, Aimée Knight, Virginia Kuhn, Viola Lasmana, Elizabeth Losh, and M. Remi Yergeau on a multimodal collection titled, “Hacking the Classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection is open access and contains eight distinct “classroom hacks” or short written pieces, for which Mary and I composed an introduction. While each author and contribution have their own angle and context, the collection as a whole combines critique with creativity and aspiration with skepticism in its approach to hacking. More specifically, it attends to various normative assumptions percolating around hacking and how they unfold in the post-secondary classroom as a space, infrastructure, and culture, with an emphasis (in our case) on camaraderie and institutional change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published “Hacking the Classroom” in &lt;em&gt;Computers and Composition Online&lt;/em&gt;, but it began as a panel during the 2012 Computers and Writing conference at North Carolina State University. Various links to it are below, including links to the collection, journal, and GitHub repo of files we produced for the project. I’ve also included the introduction to the collection, and I point to the CFP for Computers and Writing 2012 as well as a related talk I gave at the 2015 Modern Language Association Convention in Vancouver. Many thanks to Jim, Mary, Aimée, Virginia, Viola, Liz, and Remi for writing with me, and to Kris Blair at &lt;em&gt;Computers and Composition Online&lt;/em&gt; for facilitating the publication process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction, by Mary Hocks and Jentery Sayers, to “Hacking the Classroom”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
At the 2012 Computers and Writing conference, a panel of academics came together and embarked upon a series of lighting round talks, broadly focused on the topic, “Hacking the Classroom.” The organizers, Virginia Kuhn and Jentery Sayers, chose this topic because it resonates with the growing practice of hacking academia by turning the critical gaze inward, rethinking institutional structures and practices, and revising them to foster new social relationships, pedagogies, and modes of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hacking in mind, the panelists—who hailed from disparate institutions, professional positions, and disciplines—engaged the following questions: When, where, and why do classrooms in higher ed need to be hacked? How might we hack them? And under what assumptions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each panelist provided particular examples of their own hacking practices as well as aspirations to hack the classroom at their respective institutions, while addressing some obstacles, enthusiasms, and curiosities encountered along the way (including the panelists’ own skepticism about the current ubiquity of “hacking”). Since the conference, the panelists revised their presentations into this collection of multimodal pieces, designed and edited by Jentery Sayers, with co-designing by Virginia Kuhn and co-editing by Mary Hocks. The eight pieces included here not only demonstrate how hacking is variously imagined and received across disciplines; they also give everyone involved a sense of possible next steps toward institutional critique and a feeling of camaraderie during the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate context for this current piece comes from &lt;em&gt;Hacking the Academy&lt;/em&gt;, an edited, crowdsourced collection resulting from a call for contributions submitted within one week at the end of May 2010. Although an edited version appeared in 2013 from University of Michigan Press, the inspirational models continue to be available at the original &lt;em&gt;Hacking the Academy&lt;/em&gt; site, which offers a flurry of manifestos and best practices for hacking academic institutional structures, scholarship, and teaching practices. Similarly, this collection is inspired by THATCamp, the rapidly growing cluster of unconferences for humanities and technologies in which conference agendas are created, developed, and enacted by participants more or less on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking the academy through unconferences and unconventional scholarly communications fosters possibility and camaraderie while also subverting certain expectations of work and learning in the academy. In this collection, understandings of hacking emerged from earlier subversions, too. For example, Kuhn and Vitanza’s “From Gallery to Webtext” (which offers a curated session of synchronous new media projects) subverted the traditional conference presentation and later appeared in a manifesto issue of the journal, &lt;em&gt;Kairos: Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy&lt;/em&gt;. Another manifesto—&lt;em&gt;A Manifesto for Critical Media&lt;/em&gt;, by Eric Faden—called practitioners to teach media studies and production “by critically engaging film, video, and new media on their own ground and with new media’s own tools, techniques, and technologies.” Elsewhere, in 2004, Anne Wysocki simply re-defined new media in a theory-pedagogy context as attending to its own materiality and means of production. All of these inspirational statements and manifestos exemplify some of hacking’s core values: constructivist collaboration, collective learning, critique enacted through media, and an emphasis on the situated relevance of learning moments. Indeed, the crucial need for adaptable means that allow practitioners to move critically inside and out of academic structures created the kairos for this collection of classroom hacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each contribution included here creates and enacts a type of hacking practice while highlighting or reflecting on its own materiality and construction. Hacking spaces—the physical, digital, and personal spaces of classrooms—and deconstructing normative assumptions about those spaces are constant themes across these eight pieces. The contributions also hack the act of writing—as code, as soundscape, as remix, as process log, as video, as image. The referenced assignments hack popular understandings of literacy by emphasizing multiple semiotic modes, production over products, context over content, and reflective awareness over expertise. Scholarly products and content expertise are often the primary expectations of academic literacies. In response, this collection of classroom hacks encourages forms of intensive learning conducive to tinkering, experimenting, iteration, and productive discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hacking the Classroom: Eight Perspectives” offers numerous ideas for reflexive teaching and pedagogical practice. These contributions also complicate the concept of hacking, and in particular Kuhn, Losh, and Yergeau offer provocative lists of norms and assumptions about hacking. However, the authors do not expect these eight perspectives to cohere, and the collection does not suggest that hacking classrooms should be understood uniformly across settings. On the contrary, the authors hope readers will note the discontinuities and overlaps across the eight pieces, prompting further dialogue about the culture, materials, and construction of classrooms in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Modernism Meets DH</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the first half of the 2010s, I collaborated with Stephen Ross to articulate digital methods (including computational and multimodal approaches) with what Douglas Mao and Rebecca L. Walkowitz call the “new modernist studies” (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukeupress.edu/bad-modernisms&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad Modernisms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for instance). Stephen and I ultimately wrote an essay on the topic, surveying a spectrum of frameworks and scholarly projects that not only blend literary and technical practice but also highlight the complex relationships between individual modernist works and the cultures in which they were embedded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An abstract for that essay is below. It’s accompanied by links to &lt;em&gt;Literature Compass&lt;/em&gt;, where the essay was published, and related research by the MLab sand Modernist Versions Project. Thanks to Stephen for writing with me, and to David Amigoni and Tommy Davis for their editorial work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay traces some of the ways modernism and digital humanities have converged of late. It covers some of the key modes in which that convergence has so far found expression: popular websites and mobile apps, issues of copyright, the production of digital scholarly editions, the practice of versioning, questions of scale, and geospatial techniques. We cite examples of productive convergences of modernist studies and digital humanities, and articulate the issues listed above with specific research and teaching projects. Our overview advances the basic argument that there are special affinities between modernism and digital humanities and that digital approaches afford some of the most promising lines of development for the ongoing expansion of the “new modernist studies.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Public + Digital</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2013, &lt;em&gt;New American Notes Online&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;NANO&lt;/em&gt;) invited the &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt; to edit a special issue of their open access journal. We circulated a CFP in May, asking for submissions that addressed how, when, and for whom digital humanities is also public humanities, with a preference for multimodal projects that explored the intersections of technology, computation, critical theory, and social justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various links to the special issue are below, followed by the first two paragraphs of the introduction and the table of contents, which points to each of the seven essays in the issue. Many thanks to Adèle Barclay, Alex Christie, Jana Millar Usiskin, and Katie Tanigawa for editing with me; to &lt;em&gt;NANO&lt;/em&gt; founding editor, Sean Scanlan, as well as assistant editors, Rebecca Devers and Ruth Garcia; and to contributors, Rachel Arteaga, Karl Baumann, Benjamin Stokes, François Bar, Ben Caldwell, Nina Belojevic, Sam Byrd, Jimmy Ghaphery, Elise Chenier, Michelle Habell-Pallán, Sonnet Retman, Angelica Macklin, and Elizabeth Alice Honig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we circulated the call for this special issue of &lt;em&gt;NANO: New American Notes Online&lt;/em&gt;, we prompted practitioners to consider the intersections of digital methods with cultural criticism: to demonstrate how investments in technologies and computation are not necessarily antithetical to investments in critical theory and social justice. Here, we were motivated by recent research in media studies. For instance, Sharon Daniel collaborates with non-profit organizations and disenfranchised groups interested in using digital media to represent themselves. Inspired by Walter Benjamin’s “The Author as Producer,” Daniel writes: “I see myself as a context-provider stretching the concept of artistic creation from making content to making context […] A context-provider does not speak for others, but ‘induces’ others to speak for themselves by providing both the means, or tools, and the context where they can speak and be heard” (154). Among others, Daniel has worked with the HIV Education and Prevention Program of Alameda County (HEPPAC) and with women in California’s correctional facilities to digitally author and disseminate social justice research with media artist, Erik Loyer. Elsewhere, in &lt;em&gt;Debates in the Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt;, Tara McPherson brings media and cultural studies to bear on digital humanities methods, calling for “hybrid practitioners: artists-theorists, programming humanists, activist-scholars, theoretical archivists, critical race coders” (154). Central to McPherson’s remark is the claim that technologies are not merely objects; they are, or at least should be, modes through which persuasive scholarship is made, circulated, stored, and revised (155). Such a position demands a delicate balance of critical distance with immersion, or a willingness to self-reflexively examine technologies and technocultures from the inside—all in order to test the limits of relegating technologies to instruments. In a similar vein, Alexandra Juhasz advocates investigating and even hacking a popular system like YouTube, “respecting its rules and limitations, all the while repurposing its aims, and using its vernacular to engage in its analysis” (149). Skepticism and critiques of technologies, not to mention imagining and building alternatives, are thus enriched through active participation in (rather than a removal from) such systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media studies research by Daniel, McPherson, and Juhasz has deeply influenced the work we do at the Maker Lab in the Humanities, and through this issue of &lt;em&gt;NANO&lt;/em&gt; we hope to carve out a space for developing further conversations across computation and culture, with particular attention paid to digital humanities projects that are, perhaps by necessity, also public humanities projects. Four recognizable threads emerged from this overlap of investments, allowing us to better understand by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions public humanities is done digitally and digital humanities is done publicly. In the following paragraphs, we touch briefly on each of these threads: 1. the how and where of scholarly practices, 2. how digital collections are constructed and rendered public, 3. the multiple modalities of public scholarship, and 4. the importance of embodied knowledge to scholarly work. From our perspective, these four threads intertwine in the best possible ways.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making the Perfect Record</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote my dissertation on the intersections between magnetic recording and literary and cultural production from the 1850s to the early 2000s. (I had yet to learn about scope creep.) I revised and published a portion of the diss as an article in issue 85.4 of &lt;em&gt;American Literature&lt;/em&gt;, focusing on early magnetic recording experiments (1870s-1930s), including telegraphony (pictured below), and how they unfolded in American radio drama and scientific detective fiction. I concluded that article with a few remarks on what media studies might learn about digital labor today from such histories of sound reproduction, where “the power over how and when to listen demanded the freedom to plausibly deny ever making a record in the first place” (see the article’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://scalar.usc.edu/maker/record/conclusion?path=about&quot;&gt;last page&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various links to the &lt;em&gt;American Literature&lt;/em&gt; article, titled “Making the Perfect Record: From Inscription to Impression in Early Magnetic Recording,” are below. It’s open access and part of a special issue on “New Media and American Literature,” edited by Tara McPherson, Patrick Jagoda, and Wendy Chun, with contributions from Tara, Patrick, and Wendy as well as Craig Carey, Lauren Klein, Jeff Scheible, Richard Jean So, Gary Hall, Curtis Marez, Jeffrey Shandler, and Steve Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I composed “Making the Perfect Record” with the Alliance of Networking Visual Culture’s Scalar platform. I used Scalar to integrate audio, image, and video files into my argument and to provide readers with “paths” through the essay. (Choose your own adventure!) Those paths are listed at the bottom of this page. Below I also point to the GitHub repository for the article; Tara, Patrick, and Wendy’s preface for the special issue; related &lt;a href=&quot;/mlab&quot;&gt;MLab&lt;/a&gt; research; and talks I gave during the 2010s on magnetic recording and/or writing with Scalar. Alongside these talks, I had the privilege of facilitating invited workshops on Scalar at Northeastern, Kansas, Syracuse, St. Lawrence, and UW Seattle, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Tara, Wendy, and Patrick for editing “New Media and American Literature” and to Tara (Lead PI), Erik Loyer (Creative Director), Craig Dietrich (Information Design Director), Steve Anderson (Critical Commons and Archive Liaison), and the rest of the award-winning Scalar team for their feedback and incredible positive force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About “Making the Perfect Record”&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
Intended for audiences across the intersections of literary criticism and comparative media studies, this essay highlights how magnetic recording was affiliated with permanent, immaterial sound during its first six decades (1870–1930). Oberlin Smith (1878) initially framed it as a scratch-free alternative to Menlo Park recording methods and Edison’s tinfoil phonograph. That is, magnetic recording “impressed” sound; it did not “inscribe” it. Later, Valdemar Poulsen’s research on the telegraphone, including his demonstration of it at the 1900 Paris Exhibition, suggested that even then magnetic recordings could be erased and re-impressed, affording at once the immaterial and material, impermanence and permanence. However, the telegraphone was an economic failure in the United States and Europe. Intended as a mechanism for writing the voice from a distance, it was reduced solely to military use by 1917.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, author and amateur criminologist, Arthur B. Reeve, did write about the telegraphone during the 1910s and 1920s. Spanning magazines, cartoons, film, and radio, Reeve’s incredibly popular science fiction detective tales didactically introduced audiences to the presumably magical features of the relatively unknown telegraphone, mixing technical specifications with paranoia about the infallibility of forensic science and disembodied voices forever recorded on wire. With Reeve’s work in mind, this essay demonstrates how, despite the telegraphone’s economic failure, the magnetic aura of permanent, immaterial sound still gained traction in consumer markets well before tape in the 1940s. Through the use of the Scalar platform, the essay unpacks the often ignored, pre-1940s history of magnetic recording, with particular attention to how—through an interweaving of print fiction, sound transduction, and visual culture—early magnetic recording materialized. In so doing, it offers scholars of both new and old media a sense of how we might better historicize the simultaneous permanence and immateriality of contemporary computing cultures.

        <title>After the Cloud</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my ongoing interests is the intersection of storage and memory from the labor perspective, and between 2011 and 2013 I worked with Mark Williams and the &lt;em&gt;Journal of e-Media Studies&lt;/em&gt; to produce a special issue on “the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue ultimately expanded from a collection about the labor and cultural politics of cloud storage to also include interviews, reviews, and “working theory” related to digital media, activism, and transformative critique, with compelling essays by Alexis Lothian and Amanda Phillips, Nick Marx, and Anne Cong-Huyen. Adeline Koh, Mark Marino, and Jonathan Kahana interviewed Wendy Chun, Matthew Fuller, and Zoe Beloff, respectively, while Alyssa McLeod reviewed Old Maps Online, and Eric Freedman and Hollis Griffin reported back on the 2010 &lt;em&gt;Flow&lt;/em&gt; media studies conference. Eric Hoyt, Wendy Hagenmaier, and Carl Hagenmaier wrapped up the issue with a reflection on developing the Media History Digital Library and the Lantern search tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction. “Computational Cultures after the Cloud: A Special Issue of the&lt;/em&gt; Journal of e-Media Studies,&lt;em&gt;” by Jentery Sayers&lt;/em&gt; (open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/article/434&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/document/949&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An introduction to “Computational Cultures after the Cloud” (a special issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of e-Media Studies&lt;/em&gt;), this essay unpacks some stress points across the issue’s various pieces, with an emphasis on how new forms of scholarly communication and activism are engaging emerging digital economies and digital labor practices. Instead of reading computation deterministically, the introduction highlights critically affirmative approaches to the perceived immateriality of computational work, its processing, storage, and circulation included. Throughout the essay, there is an emphasis on the convergences between online and off-line activities (especially forms of organization) as well as various media types. As the essay ultimately demonstrates, the cloud is historically unique because it is simultaneously immersive and at a remove, inviting frequent and seemingly effortless participation while fostering alienation, individuation, and exploitation. Echoing work by Jonathan Beller, Wendy Chun, Alexander Galloway, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Tara McPherson, Lisa Nakamura, and Trebor Scholz (among others), this perceived effortlessness tends to mask the material conditions and technical particulars that are often sites for political, aesthetic, and performative intervention.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Can Digital Humanities Mean Transformative Critique?” by Alexis Lothian and Amanda Phillips&lt;/em&gt; (open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/article/425&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/document/958&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would digital scholarship and the humanities disciplines be like if they centered around processes and possibilities of social and cultural transformation as well as institutional preservation? If they centered around questions of labor, race, and gender and justice at personal, local, and global scales? If their practitioners considered not only how the academy might reach out to underserved communities, but also how the kinds of knowledge production nurtured elsewhere could transform the academy itself? Exploring the conversations that have centered around the Twitter hashtag #transformDH in the past two years, this essay argues that such questions are not hypothetical and that these digital humanities already exist. With the intention of inspiring further work in a similar vein, we offer a curated list of projects, people, and collaborations that suggest the possibilities of a transformative digital humanities. DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.425&quot;&gt;10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.425&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Storage Wars: Clouds, Cyberlockers, and Media Piracy in the Digital Economy,” by Nick Marx&lt;/em&gt; (open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/article/426&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/document/957&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay examines the role of online media piracy in the shift away from acquisition- and ownership-based models of consumption in favor of access-based models. In this media industry climate, cloud technologies have played an increasingly important role in providing audiences with content on their own terms. Piracy has long served a similar function, but it is taking on aspects of cloud services as well. I investigate how cloud technologies are changing media piracy activities by examining cyberlockers, web-based services that afford consumers both ubiquitous access and ownership of media content. Cyberlocker use for the illegal trade of copyrighted content, I argue, complicates conventional technological, legal, and cultural discourses about media piracy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“‘Dark Mass,’ or the Problems with Creative Cloud Labor,”
by Anne Cong-Huyen&lt;/em&gt; (open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/article/427&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourcing has been praised as a means of distributing work and lowering the costs of production for a variety of contexts: commercial, creative, not-for-profit, academic, and so on. This article examines the problematics of creative crowdsourcing, with an emphasis on labor, both as a subject of representation and as a process that involves the work of volunteers, laborers, writers, and artists. The projects examined, &lt;em&gt;Flight Paths&lt;/em&gt; and Mobile Voices (VozMob), offer two contrasting examples of such work that take migrant workers as their focus, thus providing ideal texts as a site of examination at the level of narrative, medium, context, and process. The readings offered situate the projects within the urban environments that inform them—Dubai and Los Angeles—and examine the politics of authorship and voice that must be reevaluated when studying born-digital literature. DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.427&quot;&gt;10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.427&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wendy Hui Kyong Chun in Conversation with Adeline Koh&lt;/em&gt; (open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/article/428&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/document/955&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adeline Koh speaks with Wendy Chun concerning her thoughts on a new form of interdisciplinarity in higher education. Chun discusses topics such as the tolerance of failure, and comments on the changing status of the digital humanities. She also recommends some specific skills for the 21st-century humanist. DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.428&quot;&gt;10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.428&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew Fuller in Conversation with Mark Marino&lt;/em&gt; (open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/article/429&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/document/954&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Marino interviews Matthew Fuller about developments in software studies and critical code studies over the past five years, as well as future directions for these approaches. In their conversation, the two discuss ways of creating discourse spaces for engineering, artistic, and interpretive disciplines to meet. Fuller describes ways to avoid the peril of science and technology studies (STS) becoming a kind of documentarian or attendant scribe to scientific research and commercial technological development. Fuller also offers examples of critical projects applying cultural studies to the nexus of these academic realms. DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.429&quot;&gt;10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.428&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoe Beloff in Conversation with Jonathan Kahana. “Mongrel Media and Contemporary Currency: A Conversation on Brecht,&lt;/em&gt; The Days of the Commune, &lt;em&gt;and Occupy Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; (open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/article/433&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/document/950&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Kahana conducted this conversation with Zoe Beloff in conjunction with installations of Beloff’s &lt;em&gt;The Days of the Commune&lt;/em&gt;, a multimedia project based on Bertolt Brecht’s 1956 play of the same name. Consisting of video shot during weekend rehearsals in public spaces around New York City; a performance of the play serialized to take as long as the 1871 Paris Commune; and drawings, broadsheets, and a website, Beloff’s &lt;em&gt;The Days of the Commune&lt;/em&gt; was mounted in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, and often coincided with the spaces and movements of the occupation in Manhattan. In this extended version of a dialog to be published with the Slought Foundation Blu-ray Disc of &lt;em&gt;The Days of the Commune&lt;/em&gt;, Beloff and Kahana discuss the origins and sources of the project, its relation to Beloff’s previous work, and its place in contemporary anticapitalist art, media, and activism. DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.433&quot;&gt;10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.433&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review of Old Maps Online, by Alyssa McLeod&lt;/em&gt; (open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/article/431&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/document/952&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Google Maps powered interface that allows users to search for digitized historical maps, Old Maps Online provides a uniquely spatial means of exploring online archival repositories. Although the project has been set back by funding limitations, it proves an important tool for researchers and teachers alike. DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.431&quot;&gt;10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.431&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2010&lt;/em&gt; Flow &lt;em&gt;Conference Report, by Eric Freedman and Hollis Griffin&lt;/em&gt; (open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/article/432&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/document/951&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Freedman and Hollis Griffin review the 2010 &lt;em&gt;Flow&lt;/em&gt; media studies conference. With its amalgam of roundtables and protracted yet hyperlocalized social media debates, the &lt;em&gt;Flow&lt;/em&gt; conference demonstrates some of the growing pains of an evolving, dispersed, interdisciplinary area of study. These cracks in the foundation of disciplinary logic showcase the dialogic nature of the biennial gathering, and the relative success of its varied sessions. As a transmedia enterprise that engages with complex issues, the &lt;em&gt;Flow&lt;/em&gt; conference refuses to reify formal and ideological rifts, and remains dialogic to avoid some of the pitfalls of rigidly linear approaches to scholarly inquiry. As equal parts scholarly event and hyperactive academic performance, &lt;em&gt;Flow&lt;/em&gt; provides some key insights into the contested nature of conference space itself. DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.432&quot;&gt;10.1349/PS1.1938-6060.A.432&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Media + History + Digital + Library: An Experiment in Synthesis,” by Eric Hoyt, Wendy Hagenmaier and Carl Hagenmaier&lt;/em&gt; (open access &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/article/430&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/4/document/953&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Media History Digital Library (MHDL) digitizes out-of-copyright periodicals relating to the histories of film, broadcasting, and recorded sound, and makes them widely available for public use. In this essay, the creators of the MHDL website and its new search tool, Lantern, reflect on the development process. Three goals-access, usability, and impact-drive their work, and they discuss each goal in depth. They find that a synthesis of different communities, collections, skill sets, and open source software frameworks is key to achieving these goals.

            <description>Hi. My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: &quot;JEN-tree.&quot; I spend 14.36% of the day looking for my glasses.

I'm interested in what media do across forms of fiction, from comics, novels, and radio drama to games, bots, and prototypes. How do audio, images, and text shape and escape our attention? How do we tell stories with them, and how do they tell stories about us?

I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to VCU for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from UW. 

I now work at the University of Victoria (UVic) on &lt;u&gt;W&lt;/u&gt;SÁNEĆ and lək̓ʷəŋən territories. I teach in [English](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/people/regularfaculty/sayers-jentery.php) and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT) and direct the [Praxis Studio](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/) for Comparative Media Studies. I've been at UVic since 2011.

# [Internal Grant for Experimental Worldbuilding](#internal-grant-for-experimental-worldbuilding)

*1 September 2020*

UVic awarded me an internal grant to conduct research on experimental worldbuilding in games and speculative fiction. All the funds will support graduate students in the [Praxis Studio](/praxis/). We'll spend the next two years examining how compelling worlds are not only imagined but also constructed for players, with an emphasis on the politics and design of indie games. Many thanks to UVic for this opportunity. It's the spark we all needed right now.

# [Delia Derbyshire](#delia-derbyshire)

*12 June 2020* 

Thanks to Jason Camlot, Yuliya Kondratenko, and everyone at SpokenWeb for inviting me to conduct a [virtual listening session](https://spokenweb.ca/events/virtual-listening-practice-guided-by-jentery-sayers/) on the topic of Delia Derbyshire's compositions for the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. I produced some rough and still unfinished [notes](/archive/talks/spokenweb20/) for the session that guided us through multiple (if not contradictory) ways of listening to Derbyshire's work as an entanglement of sound and science fiction. This event was tremendous fun. The discussion was rich, and I enjoyed witnessing people's responses to what they heard.

It's [official](https://twitter.com/uvicpraxis/status/1176608050263687168): The Maker Lab in the Humanities is now the [Praxis Studio](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/) for Comparative Media Studies. We've wanted to change the MLab's name for some time now, and the timing is perfect, as we'll also relocate to UVic's Clearihue building, which houses the University's Faculty of Humanities. Thanks to the Faculty and the Department of English for their continued support. We will no longer update the [MLab's website](https://maker.uvic.ca/), but I will continue to direct [our research](/praxis/) under the Lab's new name. Exciting times!

# [The Pedagogy of Paper Computers](#the-pedagogy-of-paper-computers)

*22 May 2019*

This week, I gave a [Connect U 2019](https://www.uvic.ca/connectu/) talk at UVic on the pedagogy of [&quot;Paper Computers,&quot;](/papercomputers/) a graduate seminar on tabletop game design I taught last fall. Here are my [slides](/archive/talks/connectu/). They include a rationale for the course as well as some photographs of games that students prototyped. During the talk, I explained how and why &quot;Paper Computers&quot; encouraged students to develop procedural literacy, experiment with low-tech methods, engage histories and cultures of media, understand contexts of play and use, design critically, and connect with communities of practice. I then articulated these six areas with the notion of prototyping the past: in this case, making games informed by literary and political movements from the 19th and 20th centuries. Thanks to UVic for inviting me to speak at this event, and to David Leach for joining me. It was a pleasure.

# [Low-Tech Approaches to Digital Research](#low-tech-approaches-to-digital-research)

*26 February 2019* 

Today I gave a talk during an NEH ODH Institute on &quot;Textual Data and Digital Texts in the Undergraduate Classroom,&quot; directed by Lauren Coats and Emily McGinn. I titled it, [&quot;Low-Tech Approaches to Digital Research&quot;](archive/talks/neh), with a focus on two questions: how to approach digital research in the classroom without assuming technical competencies in computing, and how to teach important techniques often automated or masked by tools and software. I responded to both by providing examples of low-tech prototyping as inquiry. They included the use of Markdown for web development, graphical overlays for data visualization, paper manuals for game design, cardboard models for media history, wireframes for conjectural criticism, remediations for archival work, and zines for science and technology studies. Thanks to Lauren and Emily for inviting me to participate in this timely institute, which resulted in a compelling collection of open access materials: [*Digital Texts and Textual Data: A Pedagogical Anthology*](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:28413/).

# [Tabletop Inquiry](#tabletop-inquiry)

*5 December 2018*

I wrote a reflection on my [&quot;Paper Computers&quot;](/papercomputers/) seminar. It's intended for graduate students in the course; however, I hope it's of use to other people, including those who are interested in media studies. It's titled [&quot;Tabletop Inquiry&quot;](/tabletop/) and consists of three point-form lists. The [first](/tabletop/#observations) is a series of observations made while studying and prototyping paper computers this semester; it's meant to document and distill some of our seminar conversations. The [second list](/tabletop/#prompts-for-project-design) outlines some questions prompted by tabletop prototyping for project design in the humanities; it's meant to highlight how tabletop prototyping may apply to a broader set of research practices (not just to games). The [third list](/tabletop/#types-of-prototypes) itemizes types of prototypes for engaging history; it's meant to provide a working vocabulary for prototyping as a form of criticism. Thanks again to Avery Alder, Nina Belojevic, Whitney &quot;Strix&quot; Beltrán, Anne Burdick, Emily Care Boss, Alexander Galloway, Amy Hildreth Chen, Isaac Childres, Derek Hansen, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Kari Kraus, Michael Lines, Shaun Macpherson, Renee M. Shelby, Nikki Valens, and Lara Wilson for contributing to the seminar as guest speakers. It was a joy to teach.

# [Types of Prototypes](#types-of-prototypes)

*4 December 2018* 

I developed a resource titled [&quot;Types of Prototypes&quot;](/typesofprototypes/) for people who are curious about how prototyping or &quot;remaking&quot; source materials intersects with the praxis of literary and textual criticism. It lists seven types of prototypes and explains what they help us to better understand. Then it describes how prototyping may be a form of criticism. It concludes by explaining how prototypes &quot;address us.&quot; Inspired by Kari Kraus's research, I'm using this framework for a few ongoing projects.

# [SSHRC Grant for HASTAC 2019](#sshrc-grant-for-hastac-2019)

*29 November 2018* 

David Gaertner and I received a SSHRC Connection Grant to support the [next HASTAC conference](https://hastac2019.github.io/), scheduled for 16-18 May 2019. HASTAC will partner with UVic English and the Institute for Critical Indigenous Studies at the University of British Columbia, and they will be guests on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓-speaking Musqueam (xʷməθkʷəy̓əm) people. The conference theme is &quot;Decolonizing Technologies, Reprogramming Education.&quot; Marisa Duarte, Jules Arita Koostachin, Elizabeth LaPensée, Karyn Recollet, Alana Sayers, and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson will give plenaries, and Melody McIvor will be performing. 

Many thanks to our [organizers, sponsors, and volunteers](https://hastac2019.github.io/about.html) and to Musqueam artist, Diamond Point, who designed the [conference logo](https://hastac2019.github.io/assets/images/logo.png).

# [Before You Make a Thing](#before-you-make-a-thing)

*15 November 2018*

To help undergraduate students in [&quot;Prototyping Pasts and Futures&quot;](archive/syllabi/200/) apply science and technology studies to prototyping and project design, I created a resource titled, [&quot;Before You Make a Thing.&quot;](/beforeyou/) It consists of three point-form lists. The [first](/beforeyou/#theories-and-concepts) is a series of theories and concepts drawn from assigned readings, the [second](/beforeyou/#practices) is a rundown of practices corresponding with projects we studied, and the [third](/beforeyou/#prototyping-techniques) itemizes prototyping techniques conducted in the course. I wrote the document for readers across the disciplines, partly because most students in this course are not humanities majors.

# [Sketch Model](#sketch-model)

*21 June 2018*

I just returned from Olin College of Engineering, where I was a summer fellow in the Mellon-funded Sketch Model program. Echoing Olin's [website](https://www.olin.edu/collaborate/sketch-model/), Sketch Model is &quot;a set of experimental approaches that embody the exploratory spirit of ideas-under-construction inherent in sketch models for prototyping: imagining the creative contours and operations for an expanded practice of engineering that includes the robust expressive criticality of the arts, history, and culture.&quot; Many thanks to Sara Hendren (PI), Ben Linder (PI), Debbie Chachra, and Jonathan Adler for hosting me. I gained an incredible amount of knowledge about prototyping across the disciplines (from industry and engineering to design and the humanities), and Sara and Ben did an absolutely brilliant job of bringing together a group of invested practitioners.

# [Starting in the Middle](#starting-in-the-middle)

*11 May 2018* 

Yesterday I gave a talk at the University of Puget Sound titled, &quot;Starting in the Middle,&quot; where I outlined eight pedagogical approaches to critical media practice: 1) negotiating We/I/Them/It with Text/Context, 2) the participatory observer (who is not &quot;detached&quot;), 3) boundary-making in design (contrasted with appeals to abstract functions and ideal features), 4) matters of contingency and interface (as distinct from evidence or proof), 5) the entanglements of language with materials, 6) iteration as inquiry (working with machines, not delegating tasks to them), 7) multimodal composition (rather than digitization as re-presentation), and 8) accounting for shadow pasts and futures (not only certainties). Thanks to Jane Carlin and Collins Memorial Library for inviting me, and to Jamie L. Spaine for coordinating my visit. It was exciting to see what Puget Sound is doing with media and [their new makerspace](https://research.pugetsound.edu/makerspace).

# [Designing Digital Studies Courses](#designing-digital-studies-courses)

*26 April 2018* 

The University of Washington's Department of English invited me to speak at the Simpson Center for the Humanities on the topic of designing digital studies courses for graduate students. I presented some possible three-course sequences for UW English, and I also created a resource based on the talk. It's titled, [&quot;Locating Praxis in Digital Studies&quot;](/designingcourses/). There you'll find an account of my own [background and biases](/designingcourses/#my-background-and-biases) with respect to digital studies, my working definition of [&quot;praxis&quot;](/designingcourses/#praxis), an articulation of my [aims](/designingcourses/#the-aims-of-my-digital-studies-courses) when teaching media, and---likely most important---sketches of [three-course sequences](/designingcourses/#some-possible-three-course-sequences) in stewardship, computational analysis, design and communication, social justice and transformative media, digital methods, and prototyping. If you're creating digital studies courses at your university, then I hope you'll find this resource to be useful. Thanks to UW English, including Carolyn Allen, Anis Bawarshi, Brian Reed, and Kathy Woodward, for welcoming me back to Seattle for this talk. It was lovely to be at the Simpson Center again.

# [Design and Live Methods](#design-and-live-methods)

*25 March 2018*

Since early 2017, I've been developing approaches to literary and media studies that experiment with Daniela Rosner's &quot;design as inquiry,&quot; Kari Kraus's &quot;family of subjunctive practices,&quot; and what Les Back and Nirmal Puwar call &quot;live methods.&quot; I shared some draft material at the American Institute of Graphic Arts meeting at USC in June 2017 and, more recently, during a discussion with Florida State University's Digital Scholars group. Here are my slides for those two talks: [&quot;Design and Digital Studies&quot; at AIGA](/archive/talks/aiga/) and [&quot;From Lab to Classroom&quot; at FSU](/archive/talks/fsu/). Thanks to Tarez Graban for inviting me to speak with folks at FSU, to graduate students at FSU for [responding](https://digitalscholars.wordpress.com/?s=jentery&amp;submit=Search) to my talk, and to Kate Sweetapple and Jacquie Lorber-Kasunic for presenting with me at AIGA. I'm quite excited about where this work is going.

# [Interview about &quot;What's in a Game?&quot;](#interview-about-whats-in-a-game)

*28 February 2018*

Stephanie Harrington recently interviewed me about [&quot;What's in a Game?&quot;](/whatgame) for the UVic Humanities faculty newsletter: &quot;Associate Professor of English Jentery Sayers had students in his graduate ENGL 508 Digital Literary Studies seminar create indie video games that drew on literary history. Two groups of students presented their final projects in December at Open the Arcade, an event hosted in the Digital Scholarship Commons of McPherson Library. Sayers talks to Stephanie Harrington about the process of getting students with little to no coding experience to design the games *Somapo* and *Adventures of a Sticky Leaf-Dweller*.&quot; The [entire interview](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/news/archives/get-to-know-a-teacher---jentery-sayers.php) is available online via the Faculty's website. I spoke mostly about graduate work and student achievements. Thanks, Stephanie!

# [Critical Design, Deviant Critique](#critical-design-deviant-critique)

*15 May 2016* 

Arizona State University hosted a wonderful [HASTAC 2016 conference](https://hastac2016.sched.org/event/6Dua/critical-design-deviant-critique). Kim Knight, Padmini Ray Murray, Jacqueline Wernimont, and I discussed the relationship between design and critique--or [“critical design and deviant critique”](https://maker.uvic.ca/hastac16/)--in a humanities context. I engaged six particular angles on design during my portion of the discussion: design 1) as an attribution practice, 2) as inquiry, 3) for experience, 4) for responsibility, 5) in-use, and 6) for diffraction. With material from the talk, I produced a resource titled, [&quot;Critical Design&quot;](/criticaldesign), which briefly describes each of these angles and their motivations. Many thanks to Kim, Padmini, and Jacque for presenting with me. It was a lively panel with an engaging Q&amp;A session.

*6 April 2016* 

I visited the Center for Digital Scholarship and Curation (CDSC) at Washington State University this week. Many thanks to Kim Christen, Michael Wynne, and Trevor Bond for hosting me. While I was there I gave a talk titled, [&quot;Remaking Old Media across the Disciplines&quot;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttPUUFf9Pv4). Given the importance of historical particulars to this research, not to mention my proclivity for tangents, I decided to read a paper with slides for this one. The video includes my slides as well as the Q&amp;A session. 

I enjoyed returning to WSU, which I first visited in 2009 to attend a THATCamp. Thanks again, Kim, Michael, and Trevor. The CDSC is doing brilliant work at the intersection of technologies, ethics, and social empowerment.

# [Prototyping as Composition](#prototyping-as-composition)

*7 March 2016* 

After my talk at [Cornell](#prototyping-absence), I traveled to Syracuse University to not only speak about the overlaps of [prototyping with writing studies](archive/talks/syracuse/) but also conduct a Scalar workshop for students. I had a chance as well to visit the awe-inspiring [Belfer Audio Laboratory and Archive](https://library.syr.edu/scrc/collections/preservation/belfer-lab.php). Many thanks to Patrick Berry, Collin Brooke, Patrick Williams, and Jason Markins for hosting me, and to Jenny Doctor for giving me a tour of the Belfer Lab and Archive. Here's my abstract for the &quot;Prototyping as Composition&quot; talk: 

&quot;Across the humanities, art, design, engineering, as well as numerous memory institutions, researchers are giving digital fabrication techniques such as 3-D printing significant attention. In response, this talk examines the affordances of fabrication for scholarly communication, with particular attention to rapid prototyping, or the iterative production of abstract models in tactile form, as a compositional strategy. Against the grain of the techno-evangelism and hype often witnessed in maker cultures, I outline the relationships between writing academic essays and producing tactile objects with computer numerical control (CNC) machines such as laser cutters, millers, spindles, and printers. Instead of suggesting that writing is somehow secondary to the primary experience of making things, I underscore how prototyping is intricately entangled with archival research and the writing that emerges through that research.&quot;

# [Prototyping Absence](#prototyping-absence)

*6 March 2016* 

Last week I had the honor of giving a talk on [&quot;Prototyping Absence&quot;](https://events.cornell.edu/event/jentery_sayers_prototyping_absence_remaking_old_media) at the Society for the Humanities at Cornell University. Many thanks to Tim Murray for inviting and hosting me. It was beyond humbling to be in the [A.D. White House](https://societyhumanities.as.cornell.edu/ad-white-house) to discuss my research with scholars there. Here's my abstract for the talk:  

&quot;When conducting archival research, historians of media and technology frequently encounter devices that no longer work or existed only as illustrations, fictions, or one-offs. Rather than studying such uncertainty at a remove, this talk outlines ways to prototype absences in the historical record. It draws from examples of remaking old media to demonstrate how prototyping the past affords unique approaches to examining the contingent relations between matter and meaning, without fetishizing exact reproductions of historical artifacts.&quot;

# [2015 ACH Elections](#2015-ach-elections)

*20 November 2015* 

The [Association for Computers and the Humanities](https://ach.org/blog/2015/11/20/candidate-statements/) recently nominated me to serve on its executive council for three years. ACH members have until Thursday, December 10th to vote. As a council member, I would stress the importance of pedagogy, interdisciplinary collaboration, social justice initiatives, and mentoring programs for early career practitioners. I also think laboratory- and library-based learning are fundamental to the histories and trajectories of digital humanities, and I would encourage more ACH activities involving the arts and experimental media. 

I'm among inimitable company on the ballot: Laura Mandell, Lauren Klein, Jean Bauer, Kalani Craig, Amanda Visconti, Micki Kaufman, Jim McGrath, Scott Weingart, and Francesco Levato. Voting for any of these nominees is a win for the ACH.

Hendry writes, &quot;Circuit boards, screwdrivers and 3D printers aren't typically found in a university’s humanities faculty, but the University of Victoria’s Maker Lab in the Humanities is no ordinary place. Opened in 2012, the Maker Lab follows the recent trend of 'makerspaces' – collaborative, community-based workshops stocked with tools and materials for people to experiment with and create new things. But, what sets the UVic lab apart is blending this 'makerspace ethos' with the humanities.&quot; 

All of us at the MLab would like to thank Hendry for taking the time to learn about our research, and for addressing lab spaces and research infrastructures as cultural issues.

# [CFI/FCI Grant for a Humanities Makerspace](#cfifci-grant-for-a-humanities-makerspace)

*11 March 2014*

I'm very happy to announce that the [Maker Lab](https://maker.uvic.ca/cfi/) received support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) / Fondation canadienne pour l’innovation (FCI) John R. Evans Leaders Fund for &quot;The Makerspace for Desktop Fabrication and Physical Computing in the Humanities.&quot; This grant will provide the MLab with the infrastructure to scan, model, prototype, fabricate, customize, network, and share three-dimensional objects across digital and analog environments. 

With that infrastructure, the MLab aims to: 1) foster a new research environment in humanities physical computing and desktop fabrication; 2) articulate and share best practices for digitizing, modelling, manufacturing, and networking 3D objects in humanities contexts; 3) develop easy-to-adopt workflows for digitally delivering cultural materials in 3D; 4) train highly qualified personnel for collaborative fabrication and physical computing research in non-STEM fields; 5) extend the humanities through fabrication and physical computing research; 6) blend aesthetic and cultural innovations with technical innovations; and 7) actively contribute to Canada's digital economy by reducing waste and manufacturing costs, increasing awareness of new technologies, and deepening our popular understanding of fair and ethical uses of 3D modelling, fabrication, and interactive physical systems.

# [How to Lie with Computer Vision](#how-to-lie-with-computer-vision)

*16 September 2013* 

I had the pleasure of giving a keynote at the University of Kansas's [&quot;Return to the Material&quot;](https://idrh.ku.edu/dhforum2013) symposium this weekend. The title of my talk was [&quot;Fabrications, or How to Lie with Computer Vision&quot;](/archive/talks/kansas/keynote/). It was [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4arwvdC7Z4). Whitney Trettien and Colin Allen gave keynotes as well, and all three of us offered workshops. Thanks to the inimitable Arienne Dwyer and Brian Rosenblum for inviting me. &quot;Return to the Material&quot; was a brilliant, timely, and engaging event. I hope we see more like it.

# [Working with Historical Audio](#working-with-historical-audio)

*3 August 2013* 

This weekend, I was a plenary speaker at the [&quot;Editing Modernism On and Off the Page&quot;](https://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/2013/07/10/ubc-hosts-editing-modernism-on-and-off-the-page-summer-institute/) institute on UBC's beautiful Okanagan campus. My talk was about [&quot;Editing, Annotating, and Discovering Historical Audio.&quot;](/archive/talks/temic2013/) I drew heavily from material in my dissertation, and after the talk I was fortunate to hear George Bowering, Frank Davey, Daphne Marlatt, Fred Wah, and Sharon Thesen each read their own work. Many thanks to Karis Shearer for inviting me to UBCO.

# [From 2D to 3D](#from-2d-to-3d)

*22 July 2013* 

The annual Digital Humanities conference was at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln this summer. Jeremy Boggs, Devon Elliot, and I conducted a [workshop](http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/workshops-009.html) on desktop fabrication and then gave a [talk](http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-441.html) on the same topic, both around the theme of moving from 2D to 3D in humanities research. We published our [slides](/archive/talks/dh2013/madetomake/), and our [notes](/archive/talks/dh2013/) contain what we hope will be a useful bibliography for anyone with interests in fabrication, physical computing, and the humanities. Thank you, Jeremy and Devon, for collaborating with me on this work.

# [The MLab's Website Is Live](#the-mlabs-website-is-live)

*23 May 2013* 

The [website](https://maker.uvic.ca/) for the Maker Lab in the Humanities is [live](https://twitter.com/jenterysayers/status/337599352677744640?s=20). It took me a few months to design, build, and populate, but I hope the results are worth the time and effort. The site already contains over 40 posts by our team of eleven people, and thanks to artist, Grace Yang, the MLab even has a [logo](https://maker.uvic.ca/mLabLogoFull.png).  

We will do our best to share our research, including our [Crocodile Café exhibit](https://maker.uvic.ca/croc/) as well as our [collaborations with the MVP](https://maker.uvic.ca/mod/), as it all unfolds. We are also considering what it means for a humanities lab to function as a [makerspace](https://maker.uvic.ca/makerspace/). What *is* a humanities makerspace, and under what cultural assumptions might it operate?

# [Internal Grant for Allied Audio Archives](#internal-grant-for-allied-audio-archives)

*6 September 2012* 

I received an internal research grant from UVic to start the &quot;Allied Audio Archives&quot; project. The aim of the project is to collocate audio from institutions and communities across the Pacific Northwest (U.S. and Canada) and produce online exhibits that showcase and historicize regional audio cultures. I'm using the internal funding to support a graduate research assistant (Shaun Macpherson) in designing and developing our first exhibit, which will contextualize the University of Washington's [Crocodile Café Collection](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/croc) with interviews, ephemera, local history, and cultural criticism. 

Many thanks to John Vallier at UW for helping me to facilitate this project, which began in 2010-11 when I was teaching [Media and Communication Studies](https://jenteryteaches.com/343/) at UW Bothell.

# [Writing with Sound](#writing-with-sound)

*26 July 2012*

I've been thinking through the theme of &quot;Writing with Sound&quot; for about a year now, and this month I gave a [talk](https://web.archive.org/web/20161224194437/https://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/conference/programme/abstracts/writing-with-sound-composing-multimodal-long-form-scholarship/) on the topic at the University of Hamburg during the 2012 Digital Humanities conference. It was [recorded](https://lecture2go.uni-hamburg.de/l2go/-/get/v/13920), and one question I considered is how critics might compose responsive content for audiences who are reading, watching, *and* listening to their material. 

The talk drew heavily from my work on the Scalar platform as well as a [piece](http://mediacommons.org/tne/pieces/writing-sound) I published over at *The New Everyday* as part of Kari Kraus's wonderful collection, [&quot;Rough Cuts: Media and Design in Process&quot;](http://mediacommons.org/tne/cluster/rough-cuts-media-and-design-process), which features work by Katharine Beutner, Elizabeth Bonsignore, Nicholas Chen, Christy Dena, Rachel Donahue, Ken Eklund, Jason Farman, Ann Fraistat, Oliver Gaycken, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Henry Lowood, Nick Montfort, Rick Prelinger, Ernesto Priego, Rita Raley, Gabriela Redwine, Marc Ruppel, Mark Sample, Rita Shewbridge, Amanda Visconti, Greg Walsh, and Joshua Weiner. Many thanks to Kari for her unparalleled editorial work.

# [SSHRC Grant for the Modernist Versions Project](#sshrc-grant-for-the-modernist-versions-project)

*20 June 2012* 

Congratulations to my colleague, Stephen Ross, who is the principal investigator of the [Modernist Versions Project](https://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/), which received a SSHRC Partnership Development Grant for three years. I'm excited to contribute to the MVP. It aims to advance the potential for comparative interpretations of modernist texts that exist in multiple forms by digitizing, collating, versioning, and visualizing them individually and in combination. Its primary mission is to enable new critical insights that are difficult without digital or computational approaches. More details over at [UVic News](https://www.uvic.ca/news/topics/2012+rejoicing-for-joyce-among-others+media-tip).

# [UW Graduate Medal in the Humanities](#uw-graduate-medal-in-the-humanities)

*1 July 2011* 

I am honored to receive the University of Washington's 2011 College of Arts and Sciences Graduate Medal in the Humanities. According to the College's newsletter, [*Perspectives*](https://web.archive.org/web/20110827094332/https://www.artsci.washington.edu/newsletter/June11/DeansMedalists.asp), &quot;[e]ach year, the College of Arts and Sciences presents the Dean's Medal to four exceptional graduating seniors, representing the College's four divisions — arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Now the College is celebrating its graduate students as well, with the introduction of an annual Graduate Medal, also with one recipient per division. 'These annual medals are an opportunity to shine a spotlight on some of our very best students,' says Ana Mari Cauce, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. 'Our graduate students deserve to share in that spotlight. With so many remarkable students, the challenge is to limit our selection to one undergraduate and one graduate student from each of our divisions.'&quot;

Many thanks to the College and Dean Cauce for their work, their support, and this kind gesture. Congratulations as well to the other inaugural graduate medalists: Heather Raikes (Arts), Juned Shaikh (Social Sciences), and Aurelia Honerkamp-Smith (Natural Sciences). Such stellar company!
