<h1 class="c-article__title" id="who">Who We Are</h1>
</header>

<p>We are a group of researchers who study the aesthetics and politics of media by blending theory and history with storytelling and prototyping:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Samuel Adesubokan</b> (English)</li>
<li><b>Tracey El Hajj</b> (English; graduated in 2020)</li>
<li><b>Julie M. Funk</b> (English and CSPT)</li>
<li><b>Braeden Hallman</b> (English)</li>
<li><b>Stefan Higgins</b> (English and CSPT; graduated in 2020)</li>
<li><b>Madyson Huck</b> (English)</li> 
<li><b>Hector Lopez</b> (English; graduated in 2020)</li>
<li><b>Faith Ryan</b> (English; graduated in 2021)</li>
<li><b>Alana Sayers</b> (English; 2019-21)</li>
<li><b>Jentery Sayers</b> (English and CSPT; director)</li>
<li><b>Lexy Townsend</b> (English; 2020-21)</li>
<li><b>Asia Tyson</b> (English)</li>
</ul>

<p>We value decolonization, situated knowledge, the space of place, and integrative approaches to media: old + new, analog + digital, still + moving, popular + experimental, immersive + meta.</p> 

<p>We respectfully acknowledge that our studio is located on the unceded territory of the Lkwungen peoples and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and W̱SÁNEĆ First Nations, whose ongoing historical relationships with the land continue to this day.</p> 

<hr />
<header class="c-article__header">
    <h1 class="c-article__title" id="what">What We Do</h1>
  </header>
<p>We identify pressing topics in media studies, articulate them as studio themes, research and write about them, prototype scenarios for them, and facilitate events to engage them. Our current themes are:
<ul> 
<li><b>Player Stories</b>: examining how people document and narrate their experiences with games</li>
<li><b>Uncanning Sounds</b>: bringing literary audio from the past into the present</li>
<li><b>Experimental Worldbuilding</b>: imagining better worlds for games and playable fictions</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd like to know more about our research, then please don't hesitate to <a href="#contact">contact us</a> or attend an <a href="#news">event</a>.</p>

<h1 class="c-article__title" id="not">What We Aren't</h1>
</header>

<p>We are not a blog, brand, dev team, fab lab, digital humanities project, or humanities computing centre. We do not offer courses, either, but if you want to learn about digital tools and methodologies, then we recommend contacting our amazing colleagues at the <a href="https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/dsc/">Digital Scholarship Commons</a> (DSC), <a href="https://ocam.library.uvic.ca/index.php">Obsolete Computing and Media</a> (OCaM), and the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/hcmc/">Humanities Computing and Media Centre</a> (HCMC).</p> 

<hr />
<header class="c-article__header">
<h1 class="c-article__title" id="support">Support and History</h1>
</header>

<p>We are housed in the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Victoria; we partner with English, Visual Arts, the HCMC, and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought; and we collaborate with the DSC and Special Collections. We are members of the <a href="https://spokenweb.ca/">SpokenWeb</a> project, and our research is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and the SpokenWeb SSHRC partnership network. We began as The Maker Lab in the Humanities in 2012 and became <b>The Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies</b> in 2019. All work belongs to our researchers (not to the studio), and no position is unpaid.</p>
