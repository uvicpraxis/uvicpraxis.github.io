<p>Among the most fascinating aspects of games are the stories players tell with them. This <a href="https://uvicpraxis.github.io/">Praxis Studio</a> speaker series attends to how we study, document, and narrate play. Each event is an informal conversation with our visiting speaker and a part of the "Player Stories" <a href="https://jentery.github.io/506v3/">seminar</a> (Fall 2022) in English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought.</p>

<p>Every event is public + online, and we provide Zoom URLs for each. Please note that the schedule is subject to change. Thanks for your time. We hope to see you soon.</p>
