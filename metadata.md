# Gameplay Footage Collection 

The following lists contain the metadata fields for the Praxis Studio's [Gameplay Footage Collection](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/pressrecord.html), intended for Media Studies courses and research at UVic. The Collection contains short clips (30 seconds to five minutes long) of gameplay stored for discovery in [Echo360](https://support.echo360.com/hc/en-us). We limit the number of clips per game to five, and we do not include clips that are NSFW or spoil the ending(s) to a game. Most clips contain footage from the first hour or so of the game. 

The metadata for each clip appears in its Echo360 title for search purposes, and all of the Collection's metadata is stored in a spreadsheet we update each term. The spreadsheet can also be used for search purposes. 

Project leads: Jentery Sayers and Charlie Susheski

This is an empty text field without a controlled vocabulary. This field is intended for quotes from relevant scholarship, reviews, or criticism (one quote per clip). "'in 80 Days Passepartout['s] perceived whiteness and masculinity and Frenchness never go unremarked. We don't treat these as though they are "normal," or automatically powerful. We mark bits of the map as off limits because of them, we have NPCs deny you authority and question your motives because of it. Whiteness and masculinity make you an outsider in 80 Days more often than it allows you within the circle. We remind players of Passepartout's social and cultural limitations. NPCs will often discuss their plans, goals, and ideas with Passepartout — but we very rarely allow Passepartout to make a choice for them.'  — [Meghna Jayanth](https://medium.com/@betterthemask/forget-protagonists-writing-npcs-with-agency-for-80-days-and-beyond-703201a2309) (writer for the game) in 2016" is an example of data intended for this field.
