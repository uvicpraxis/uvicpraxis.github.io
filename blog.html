<p><em>22 May 2019</em></p>

<p>This week, I gave a <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/connectu/">Connect U 2019</a> talk at UVic on the pedagogy of <a href="/papercomputers/">“Paper Computers,”</a> a graduate seminar on tabletop game design I taught last fall. Here are my <a href="/archive/talks/connectu/">slides</a>. They include a rationale for the course as well as some photographs of games that students prototyped. During the talk, I explained how and why “Paper Computers” encouraged students to develop procedural literacy, experiment with low-tech methods, engage histories and cultures of media, understand contexts of play and use, design critically, and connect with communities of practice. I then articulated these six areas with the notion of prototyping the past: in this case, making games informed by literary and political movements from the 19th and 20th centuries. Thanks to UVic for inviting me to speak at this event, and to David Leach for joining me. It was a pleasure.</p>

<h1 id="low-tech-approaches-to-digital-research"><a href="#low-tech-approaches-to-digital-research">Low-Tech Approaches to Digital Research</a></h1>

<p><em>26 February 2019</em></p>

<p>Today I gave a talk during an NEH ODH Institute on “Textual Data and Digital Texts in the Undergraduate Classroom,” directed by Lauren Coats and Emily McGinn. I titled it, <a href="archive/talks/neh">“Low-Tech Approaches to Digital Research”</a>, with a focus on two questions: how to approach digital research in the classroom without assuming technical competencies in computing, and how to teach important techniques often automated or masked by tools and software. I responded to both by providing examples of low-tech prototyping as inquiry. They included the use of Markdown for web development, graphical overlays for data visualization, paper manuals for game design, cardboard models for media history, wireframes for conjectural criticism, remediations for archival work, and zines for science and technology studies. Thanks to Lauren and Emily for inviting me to participate in this timely institute, which resulted in a compelling collection of open access materials: <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:28413/"><em>Digital Texts and Textual Data: A Pedagogical Anthology</em></a>.</p>

<h1 id="tabletop-inquiry"><a href="#tabletop-inquiry">Tabletop Inquiry</a></h1>

<p><em>5 December 2018</em></p>

<p>I wrote a reflection on my <a href="/papercomputers/">“Paper Computers”</a> seminar. It’s intended for graduate students in the course; however, I hope it’s of use to other people, including those who are interested in media studies. It’s titled <a href="/tabletop/">“Tabletop Inquiry”</a> and consists of three point-form lists. The <a href="/tabletop/#observations">first</a> is a series of observations made while studying and prototyping paper computers this semester; it’s meant to document and distill some of our seminar conversations. The <a href="/tabletop/#prompts-for-project-design">second list</a> outlines some questions prompted by tabletop prototyping for project design in the humanities; it’s meant to highlight how tabletop prototyping may apply to a broader set of research practices (not just to games). The <a href="/tabletop/#types-of-prototypes">third list</a> itemizes types of prototypes for engaging history; it’s meant to provide a working vocabulary for prototyping as a form of criticism. Thanks again to Avery Alder, Nina Belojevic, Whitney “Strix” Beltrán, Anne Burdick, Emily Care Boss, Alexander Galloway, Amy Hildreth Chen, Isaac Childres, Derek Hansen, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Kari Kraus, Michael Lines, Shaun Macpherson, Renee M. Shelby, Nikki Valens, and Lara Wilson for contributing to the seminar as guest speakers. It was a joy to teach.</p>

<p><em>4 December 2018</em></p>

<p>I developed a resource titled <a href="/typesofprototypes/">“Types of Prototypes”</a> for people who are curious about how prototyping or “remaking” source materials intersects with the praxis of literary and textual criticism. It lists seven types of prototypes and explains what they help us to better understand. Then it describes how prototyping may be a form of criticism. It concludes by explaining how prototypes “address us.” Inspired by Kari Kraus’s research, I’m using this framework for a few ongoing projects.</p>

<p>David Gaertner and I received a SSHRC Connection Grant to support the <a href="https://hastac2019.github.io/">next HASTAC conference</a>, scheduled for 16-18 May 2019. HASTAC will partner with UVic English and the Institute for Critical Indigenous Studies at the University of British Columbia, and they will be guests on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓-speaking Musqueam (xʷməθkʷəy̓əm) people. The conference theme is “Decolonizing Technologies, Reprogramming Education.” Marisa Duarte, Jules Arita Koostachin, Elizabeth LaPensée, Karyn Recollet, Alana Sayers, and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson will give plenaries, and Melody McIvor will be performing.</p>

<p><em>15 November 2018</em></p>

<p>To help undergraduate students in <a href="archive/syllabi/200/">“Prototyping Pasts and Futures”</a> apply science and technology studies to prototyping and project design, I created a resource titled, <a href="/beforeyou/">“Before You Make a Thing.”</a> It consists of three point-form lists. The <a href="/beforeyou/#theories-and-concepts">first</a> is a series of theories and concepts drawn from assigned readings, the <a href="/beforeyou/#practices">second</a> is a rundown of practices corresponding with projects we studied, and the <a href="/beforeyou/#prototyping-techniques">third</a> itemizes prototyping techniques conducted in the course. I wrote the document for readers across the disciplines, partly because most students in this course are not humanities majors.</p>

<h1 id="sketch-model"><a href="#sketch-model">Sketch Model</a></h1>

<p><em>21 June 2018</em></p>

<p>I just returned from Olin College of Engineering, where I was a summer fellow in the Mellon-funded Sketch Model program. Echoing Olin’s <a href="https://www.olin.edu/collaborate/sketch-model/">website</a>, Sketch Model is “a set of experimental approaches that embody the exploratory spirit of ideas-under-construction inherent in sketch models for prototyping: imagining the creative contours and operations for an expanded practice of engineering that includes the robust expressive criticality of the arts, history, and culture.” Many thanks to Sara Hendren (PI), Ben Linder (PI), Debbie Chachra, and Jonathan Adler for hosting me. I gained an incredible amount of knowledge about prototyping across the disciplines (from industry and engineering to design and the humanities), and Sara and Ben did an absolutely brilliant job of bringing together a group of invested practitioners.</p>

<p><em>11 May 2018</em></p>

<p>Yesterday I gave a talk at the University of Puget Sound titled, “Starting in the Middle,” where I outlined eight pedagogical approaches to critical media practice: 1) negotiating We/I/Them/It with Text/Context, 2) the participatory observer (who is not “detached”), 3) boundary-making in design (contrasted with appeals to abstract functions and ideal features), 4) matters of contingency and interface (as distinct from evidence or proof), 5) the entanglements of language with materials, 6) iteration as inquiry (working with machines, not delegating tasks to them), 7) multimodal composition (rather than digitization as re-presentation), and 8) accounting for shadow pasts and futures (not only certainties). Thanks to Jane Carlin and Collins Memorial Library for inviting me, and to Jamie L. Spaine for coordinating my visit. It was exciting to see what Puget Sound is doing with media and <a href="https://research.pugetsound.edu/makerspace">their new makerspace</a>.</p>

There you’ll find an account of my own <a href="/designingcourses/#my-background-and-biases">background and biases</a> with respect to digital studies, my working definition of <a href="/designingcourses/#praxis">“praxis”</a>, an articulation of my <a href="/designingcourses/#the-aims-of-my-digital-studies-courses">aims</a> when teaching media, and—likely most important—sketches of <a href="/designingcourses/#some-possible-three-course-sequences">three-course sequences</a> in stewardship, computational analysis, design and communication, social justice and transformative media, digital methods, and prototyping. If you’re creating digital studies courses at your university, then I hope you’ll find this resource to be useful. Thanks to UW English, including Carolyn Allen, Anis Bawarshi, Brian Reed, and Kathy Woodward, for welcoming me back to Seattle for this talk. It was lovely to be at the Simpson Center again.</p>

<p><em>25 March 2018</em></p>

<p>Since early 2017, I’ve been developing approaches to literary and media studies that experiment with Daniela Rosner’s “design as inquiry,” Kari Kraus’s “family of subjunctive practices,” and what Les Back and Nirmal Puwar call “live methods.” I shared some draft material at the American Institute of Graphic Arts meeting at USC in June 2017 and, more recently, during a discussion with Florida State University’s Digital Scholars group. Here are my slides for those two talks: <a href="/archive/talks/aiga/">“Design and Digital Studies” at AIGA</a> and <a href="/archive/talks/fsu/">“From Lab to Classroom” at FSU</a>. Thanks to Tarez Graban for inviting me to speak with folks at FSU, to graduate students at FSU for <a href="https://digitalscholars.wordpress.com/?s=jentery&amp;submit=Search">responding</a> to my talk, and to Kate Sweetapple and Jacquie Lorber-Kasunic for presenting with me at AIGA.

<p>Stephanie Harrington recently interviewed me about <a href="/whatgame">“What’s in a Game?”</a> for the UVic Humanities faculty newsletter: “Associate Professor of English Jentery Sayers had students in his graduate ENGL 508 Digital Literary Studies seminar create indie video games that drew on literary history. Two groups of students presented their final projects in December at Open the Arcade, an event hosted in the Digital Scholarship Commons of McPherson Library. Sayers talks to Stephanie Harrington about the process of getting students with little to no coding experience to design the games <em>Somapo</em> and <em>Adventures of a Sticky Leaf-Dweller</em>.” The <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/news/archives/get-to-know-a-teacher---jentery-sayers.php">entire interview</a> is available online via the Faculty’s website.

Kim Knight, Padmini Ray Murray, Jacqueline Wernimont, and I discussed the relationship between design and critique–or <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/hastac16/">“critical design and deviant critique”</a>–in a humanities context. I engaged six particular angles on design during my portion of the discussion: design 1) as an attribution practice, 2) as inquiry, 3) for experience, 4) for responsibility, 5) in-use, and 6) for diffraction. With material from the talk, I produced a resource titled, <a href="/criticaldesign">“Critical Design”</a>, which briefly describes each of these angles and their motivations.

<p><em>7 March 2016</em></p>

<p>After my talk at <a href="#prototyping-absence">Cornell</a>, I traveled to Syracuse University to not only speak about the overlaps of <a href="archive/talks/syracuse/">prototyping with writing studies</a> but also conduct a Scalar workshop for students. I had a chance as well to visit the awe-inspiring <a href="https://library.syr.edu/scrc/collections/preservation/belfer-lab.php">Belfer Audio Laboratory and Archive</a>. Many thanks to Patrick Berry, Collin Brooke, Patrick Williams, and Jason Markins for hosting me, and to Jenny Doctor for giving me a tour of the Belfer Lab and Archive. Here’s my abstract for the “Prototyping as Composition” talk:</p>

<p>“Across the humanities, art, design, engineering, as well as numerous memory institutions, researchers are giving digital fabrication techniques such as 3-D printing significant attention. In response, this talk examines the affordances of fabrication for scholarly communication, with particular attention to rapid prototyping, or the iterative production of abstract models in tactile form, as a compositional strategy. Against the grain of the techno-evangelism and hype often witnessed in maker cultures, I outline the relationships between writing academic essays and producing tactile objects with computer numerical control (CNC) machines such as laser cutters, millers, spindles, and printers. Instead of suggesting that writing is somehow secondary to the primary experience of making things, I underscore how prototyping is intricately entangled with archival research and the writing that emerges through that research.”</p>

<p>Last week I had the honor of giving a talk on <a href="https://events.cornell.edu/event/jentery_sayers_prototyping_absence_remaking_old_media">“Prototyping Absence”</a> at the Society for the Humanities at Cornell University. Many thanks to Tim Murray for inviting and hosting me. It was beyond humbling to be in the <a href="https://societyhumanities.as.cornell.edu/ad-white-house">A.D. White House</a> to discuss my research with scholars there. Here’s my abstract for the talk:</p>

<p>“When conducting archival research, historians of media and technology frequently encounter devices that no longer work or existed only as illustrations, fictions, or one-offs. Rather than studying such uncertainty at a remove, this talk outlines ways to prototype absences in the historical record. It draws from examples of remaking old media to demonstrate how prototyping the past affords unique approaches to examining the contingent relations between matter and meaning, without fetishizing exact reproductions of historical artifacts.”</p>

Hendry writes, “Circuit boards, screwdrivers and 3D printers aren’t typically found in a university’s humanities faculty, but the University of Victoria’s Maker Lab in the Humanities is no ordinary place. Opened in 2012, the Maker Lab follows the recent trend of ‘makerspaces’ – collaborative, community-based workshops stocked with tools and materials for people to experiment with and create new things. But, what sets the UVic lab apart is blending this ‘makerspace ethos’ with the humanities.”</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of giving a keynote at the University of Kansas’s <a href="https://idrh.ku.edu/dhforum2013">“Return to the Material”</a> symposium this weekend. The title of my talk was <a href="/archive/talks/kansas/keynote/">“Fabrications, or How to Lie with Computer Vision”</a>. It was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4arwvdC7Z4">recorded</a>. Whitney Trettien and Colin Allen gave keynotes as well, and all three of us offered workshops. Thanks to the inimitable Arienne Dwyer and Brian Rosenblum for inviting me. “Return to the Material” was a brilliant, timely, and engaging event. I hope we see more like it.</p>

<p><em>3 August 2013</em></p>

<p>This weekend, I was a plenary speaker at the <a href="https://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/2013/07/10/ubc-hosts-editing-modernism-on-and-off-the-page-summer-institute/">“Editing Modernism On and Off the Page”</a> institute on UBC’s beautiful Okanagan campus. My talk was about <a href="/archive/talks/temic2013/">“Editing, Annotating, and Discovering Historical Audio.”</a> I drew heavily from material in my dissertation, and after the talk I was fortunate to hear George Bowering, Frank Davey, Daphne Marlatt, Fred Wah, and Sharon Thesen each read their own work. Many thanks to Karis Shearer for inviting me to UBCO.</p>

<p><em>22 July 2013</em></p>

<p>The annual Digital Humanities conference was at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln this summer. Jeremy Boggs, Devon Elliot, and I conducted a <a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/workshops-009.html">workshop</a> on desktop fabrication and then gave a <a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/abstracts/ab-441.html">talk</a> on the same topic, both around the theme of moving from 2D to 3D in humanities research. We published our <a href="/archive/talks/dh2013/madetomake/">slides</a>, and our <a href="/archive/talks/dh2013/">notes</a> contain what we hope will be a useful bibliography for anyone with interests in fabrication, physical computing, and the humanities. Thank you, Jeremy and Devon, for collaborating with me on this work.</p>

<p><em>23 May 2013</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/">website</a> for the Maker Lab in the Humanities is <a href="https://twitter.com/jenterysayers/status/337599352677744640?s=20">live</a>. It took me a few months to design, build, and populate, but I hope the results are worth the time and effort. The site already contains over 40 posts by our team of eleven people, and thanks to artist, Grace Yang, the MLab even has a <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/mLabLogoFull.png">logo</a>.</p>

<p>We will do our best to share our research, including our <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/croc/">Crocodile Café exhibit</a> as well as our <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/mod/">collaborations with the MVP</a>, as it all unfolds. We are also considering what it means for a humanities lab to function as a <a href="https://maker.uvic.ca/makerspace/">makerspace</a>. What <em>is</em> a humanities makerspace, and under what cultural assumptions might it operate?</p>

<p><em>6 September 2012</em></p>

<p>I received an internal research grant from UVic to start the “Allied Audio Archives” project. The aim of the project is to collocate audio from institutions and communities across the Pacific Northwest (U.S. and Canada) and produce online exhibits that showcase and historicize regional audio cultures. I’m using the internal funding to support a graduate research assistant (Shaun Macpherson) in designing and developing our first exhibit, which will contextualize the University of Washington’s <a href="https://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/croc">Crocodile Café Collection</a> with interviews, ephemera, local history, and cultural criticism.</p>

<p>Many thanks to John Vallier at UW for helping me to facilitate this project, which began in 2010-11 when I was teaching <a href="https://jenteryteaches.com/343/">Media and Communication Studies</a> at UW Bothell.</p>

<p><em>26 July 2012</em></p>

<p>I’ve been thinking through the theme of “Writing with Sound” for about a year now, and this month I gave a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224194437/https://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/conference/programme/abstracts/writing-with-sound-composing-multimodal-long-form-scholarship/">talk</a> on the topic at the University of Hamburg during the 2012 Digital Humanities conference. It was <a href="https://lecture2go.uni-hamburg.de/l2go/-/get/v/13920">recorded</a>, and one question I considered is how critics might compose responsive content for audiences who are reading, watching, <em>and</em> listening to their material.</p>

<p>The talk drew heavily from my work on the Scalar platform as well as a <a href="http://mediacommons.org/tne/pieces/writing-sound">piece</a> I published over at <em>The New Everyday</em> as part of Kari Kraus’s wonderful collection, <a href="http://mediacommons.org/tne/cluster/rough-cuts-media-and-design-process">“Rough Cuts: Media and Design in Process”</a>, which features work by Katharine Beutner, Elizabeth Bonsignore, Nicholas Chen, Christy Dena, Rachel Donahue, Ken Eklund, Jason Farman, Ann Fraistat, Oliver Gaycken, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Henry Lowood, Nick Montfort, Rick Prelinger, Ernesto Priego, Rita Raley, Gabriela Redwine, Marc Ruppel, Mark Sample, Rita Shewbridge, Amanda Visconti, Greg Walsh, and Joshua Weiner. Many thanks to Kari for her unparalleled editorial work.</p>

<p><em>20 June 2012</em></p>

<p>Congratulations to my colleague, Stephen Ross, who is the principal investigator of the <a href="https://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/">Modernist Versions Project</a>, which received a SSHRC Partnership Development Grant for three years. I’m excited to contribute to the MVP. It aims to advance the potential for comparative interpretations of modernist texts that exist in multiple forms by digitizing, collating, versioning, and visualizing them individually and in combination. Its primary mission is to enable new critical insights that are difficult without digital or computational approaches.

<p>The University of Pittsburgh recently celebrated the launch of <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em>, published by the University of Minnesota Press. Thanks to Matt Gold (editor of <em>Debates</em>) and Jamie “Skye” Bianco (at Pitt) for inviting me to the <a href="https://www.dhrx.pitt.edu/2012/07/debates-in-the-digital-humanities-book-launch-and-symposium/">book launch</a>, where I gave a talk about “Dropping the Digital” on a panel with Jamie, Matt, Doug Armato, Elizabeth Losh, and Stephen Ramsay. It was truly an honor to visit Pitt’s 42-story Cathedral of Learning and to chat with faculty, staff, and students there.</p>

<p><em>25 October 2011</em></p>

<p>The Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln invited me to be one of three early career scholars to present at this year’s <a href="https://cdrh.unl.edu/news-events/workshoparchive">Nebraska Digital Workshop</a>. While I was there, I spoke about the process and technical particulars of composing a multimodal dissertation. I was joined by fellow invitees, Kirsten C. Uszkalo and Colin F. Wilder, as well as international scholars, Susan Brown and William G. Thomas, III, who also gave talks. Many thanks to Kay Walters and everyone at the Center for hosting me during my first visit to UNL’s campus. The Digital Workshop is such an exciting space for critical discussion and experimentation. Thanks as well to Trevor Muñoz at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities for <a href="https://mith.umd.edu/news/witches-networks-of-intellectual-history-magnetic-recording-railroads-and-womens-writing-at-the-2011-nebraska-digital-workshop/">writing</a> about the Workshop.</p>

<p><em>1 July 2011</em></p>

<p>I am honored to receive the University of Washington’s 2011 College of Arts and Sciences Graduate Medal in the Humanities. According to the College’s newsletter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110827094332/https://www.artsci.washington.edu/newsletter/June11/DeansMedalists.asp"><em>Perspectives</em></a>, “[e]ach year, the College of Arts and Sciences presents the Dean’s Medal to four exceptional graduating seniors, representing the College’s four divisions — arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Now the College is celebrating its graduate students as well, with the introduction of an annual Graduate Medal, also with one recipient per division. ‘These annual medals are an opportunity to shine a spotlight on some of our very best students,’ says Ana Mari Cauce, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. ‘Our graduate students deserve to share in that spotlight. With so many remarkable students, the challenge is to limit our selection to one undergraduate and one graduate student from each of our divisions.’”</p>

<p>Many thanks to the College and Dean Cauce for their work, their support, and this kind gesture. Congratulations as well to the other inaugural graduate medalists: Heather Raikes (Arts), Juned Shaikh (Social Sciences), and Aurelia Honerkamp-Smith (Natural Sciences). Such stellar company!</p>
